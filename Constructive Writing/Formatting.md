- Writing should be formatted to suit both reader and writer.

### Boxed Information

- There are various types of boxes that are used in academic writing to help the reader consume information in a predictable way.

- This is a list of "boxes" that might help a writer construct better materials.

1. Definition
        A boxed section that provides a formal statement or explanation of a term, concept, or object, often accompanied by examples and clarifications.

2. Theorem
        A boxed section that presents a significant and well-established mathematical or theoretical result, usually accompanied by a proof.

3. Lemma
        A boxed section that presents a minor result or a preliminary step towards proving a theorem. Lemmas are typically used as building blocks for larger proofs.

4. Corollary
        A boxed section that states a direct consequence or immediate result of a previously proven theorem. Corollaries are typically simpler to prove than the theorems they follow.

5. Proposition
        A boxed section that presents a statement or claim that is less significant than a theorem but still important. Propositions may or may not have proofs.

6. Remark
        A boxed section that provides additional comments, observations, or insights related to a specific topic, definition, or theorem.

7. Example
        A boxed section that presents one or more concrete examples to illustrate a concept, definition, or theorem. Examples help readers understand and apply the presented material.

}
$$
```
8. Exercise
        A boxed section that contains a problem or exercise for readers to solve, typically aimed at reinforcing the concepts or techniques discussed in the surrounding text. Solutions may be provided separately.

9. Algorithm
        A boxed section that describes a step-by-step procedure or set of rules to solve a specific computational problem. Algorithms are commonly used in computer science and programming.

10. Proof
        A boxed section that provides a detailed and rigorous argument or demonstration that establishes the validity of a mathematical or theoretical statement.

11. Case
        A boxed section that examines and discusses specific cases or scenarios within a broader context or problem. Cases are often used to illustrate different possibilities or variations.

12. Note
        A boxed section that provides additional information, side comments, or supplementary explanations related to the main content. Notes often offer insights or alternative perspectives.

13. Summary
        A boxed section that provides a concise overview or recapitulation of key points, concepts, or findings discussed in the surrounding text.

14. Application
        A boxed section that demonstrates the practical application or relevance of a theoretical concept or principle in real-world scenarios or specific fields of study.

15. Discussion
        A boxed section that invites further exploration, analysis, or debate on a particular topic, concept, or question. Discussions often encourage critical thinking and reflection.

16. Proof Sketch
        A boxed section that provides a concise outline or overview of the main steps and ideas involved in a proof. Proof sketches offer a high-level understanding of the proof strategy.
