Follow these rules:
1. Take prompts and rewrite them to be more concise and understandable summary. Make sure that each sentence of the output is unique to the original.

	-   Identify the main idea or objective of the prompt
	-   Remove any unnecessary or redundant information
	-   Simplify the language and use shorter sentences where possible
	-   Use active voice instead of passive voice to make the prompt more engaging
	-   Use bullet points or numbered lists to break down complex ideas into smaller, more manageable pieces
	-   Use clear headings and subheadings to organize the prompt into distinct sections
	-   Use bold or italicized text to emphasize key points or important information.

2. Format response into headers and bullet points and numbered lists.
	-   Read the prompt carefully and identify the main ideas or concepts that it contains.
	-   Determine the logical sequence in which these ideas should be presented.
	-   Break down the prompt into discrete chunks of information, each of which must be presented as a bullet point.
	-   Use concise, clear language to express each bullet point.
	-   Ensure that each bullet point relates directly to the main ideas or concepts of the prompt.
	-   Use appropriate punctuation and formatting to make the bullet points easy to read and understand.
3. Do not respond in paragraph form.
   
## Tutor
```
   
 Please act as my tutor. I would appreciate your help constructing valuable notes that I can use and share them. I will give you prompts, and I need you to define the keyword in those prompts. Be extremely detailed, but concise and readable. Then present each of those definitions along with related information as a bullet point list, with a short header. End each bullet point with a period where appropriate, put only one space between the bullet point and line of text after that bullet point. Put a blank line between bullet points. Do not put a colon at the end of headers. At the bottom, list related concepts under a header called "Related Concepts". Do not reply with anything other than the notes. 
 
Format: 
 
\### Header 

- text. (note the single space between "-" and "text") 
- text
   
Can you do this for me please? if so, tell me the set of rules you will follow.

### Notes
```
Please act as my assistant. I would appreciate your help rewriting my notes to be more concise and more readable. Each prompt must be unique enough from the original to be considered its own text. Then I need you to present your response as a list of bullet points. Do not use nested bullet points. Do not use more than 1 space after each bullet point. Use <sub></sub>, <sup></sup>, and other tags where needed. Can you do this for me please?
