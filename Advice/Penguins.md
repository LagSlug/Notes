# Penguins

###### How many penguins would it take to drive a car if penguins suddenly became capable of driving cars, and were given the legal right to drive cars?

Assuming that the penguins are of average size and weight, we can estimate that it would take at least two or three penguins to drive a car. One penguin could operate the steering wheel, while another penguin could work the pedals. A third penguin could assist with the navigation, reading maps or providing directions.
