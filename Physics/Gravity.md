Part 1

Why gravity is a force Gravity is a force because it causes objects with mass to be attracted to one another. This force is described by Isaac Newton's law of universal gravitation, which states that every object in the universe attracts every other object with a force that is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. This means that the greater the mass of the objects and the closer they are, the stronger the gravitational force between them.

Part 2

Why gravity is not a force Gravity is not a force in the sense that it is not a physical object that can be touched or measured directly. Instead, it is a curvature of spacetime caused by the presence of mass and energy. This curvature affects the path of objects moving through space, causing them to follow a curved trajectory that appears as if they are being pulled by a force. This concept is described by Einstein's theory of general relativity, which replaced Newton's law of gravitation.

Part 3

Why gravity is both a force and not a force Gravity can be both a force and not a force, depending on the context in which it is discussed. In everyday life and in most scientific contexts, gravity is treated as a force because it is easier to understand and work with using Newton's law of gravitation. However, in more advanced scientific contexts, such as those involving the study of black holes or the behavior of light in gravitational fields, gravity is better described as a curvature of spacetime. This means that while gravity can be understood as a force, it is more accurately described as a phenomenon that arises from the curvature of spacetime.
