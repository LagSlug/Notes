### Tips

- Eat from bowls, not from bags.
	  Put chips and other snacks into a single serving bowl so that food portions are easier to maintain and spoilage is reduced.

- Prioritize water.
	   Thirst can easily be mistaken as hunger.  Nothing fancy, filtered tap water is fine.. try not to waste plastic.

- Proteins and fiber.
	 The calories from proteins and fiber are preferred when breaking fast. Carbohydrates (sugars) are the easiest to convert into calories, and will halt lipid (fat) metabolism induced by the fast.

- The best salad is the one you will eat.
	  Whether it's a sprinkle of lemon juice, or a waterfall of bleu cheese, what's important is that you enjoy making fresh greens a part of *your* diet.

- Bread is okay, rice is better.
	  Bread and rice, "fortified" with essential nutrients, are healthy choices when carbohydrates are needed.
