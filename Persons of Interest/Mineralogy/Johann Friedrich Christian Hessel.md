# Johann Friedrich Christian Hessel

Johann Friedrich Christian Hessel was a German physician and professor of mineralogy in the 19th century.

## Contributions to Mineralogy and Crystallography

-   Hessel's work was noteworthy in the origins of geometric crystallography, which is concerned with the structures of crystalline solids.
-   He also made contributions to classical mineralogy, which is concerned with the chemical compositions and physical properties of minerals.

## Derivation of the Crystal Classes

-   Hessel proved that morphological forms can combine to give exactly 32 kinds of crystal symmetry in Euclidean space.
-   A crystal form denotes a set of symmetrically equivalent planes.
-   The entire set is denoted as {100}, for example, a cube-shaped crystal of fluorite.
-   The cube belongs to the isometric or tessular class, as do an octahedron and tetrahedron.
-   As of Hessel's time, not all of the 32 possible symmetries had actually been observed in real crystals.

## Re-publication and Similar Findings

-   Hessel's work originally appeared in 1830 as an article in Gehler’s Physikalische Wörterbuch.
-   It went unnoticed until it was republished in 1897 as part of a collection of papers on crystallography in Oswalds Klassiker der exakten Wissenschaften.
-   Similar findings had been reported by the French scientist Auguste Bravais and the Russian crystallographer Alex V. Gadolin.

## Space Lattices and External Morphology

-   Hessel's derivations, Bravais' and Gadolin's were based on external crystal morphology rather than a crystal's internal structural arrangement.
-   After seminal work on space lattices, the connection between space lattices and the external morphology of crystals was espoused by Paul Niggli.
-   The symmetry of the motif is the true point group symmetry of the crystal and it causes the symmetry of the external forms.
