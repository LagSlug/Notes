# Minecraft and Racism

### Villagers

- Very large noses
- Traders
- Gemstone currency

### Skeletons

- White - Skeleton
- Black -  <u>With</u>er Skeleton ( _ _ _ _ er Skeleton)

### Enderman

- Added in 1.8
- Tall black hostile mob
- Screams and then attacks if you look at it for too long
- Steals blocks

### Melon Slice & Cooked Chicken

- Both added at the same time as Enderman, in 1.8

### Conclusion

I think Notch is probably racist.
