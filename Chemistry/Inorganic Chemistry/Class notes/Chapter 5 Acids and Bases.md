- lewis acids and bases
- hard and soft acids and bases
- The smallest positive charge and the smallest negative charge in chemistry

Electron transfer (from Reducing Agent to Oxidizing agent): Redox Reactions (one or more electrons)

- A base always donates electrons, or accepts a proton.
- An acid always accepts electrons, or donates a proton.

#### Hard and Soft Classification of Lewis Acids and Bases

- hard or soft refers to how easy it is to disturb the electron cloud in an atom/ion (polarizability)

- In general, small atomic size (high positive charge) means "hard"

	Hard acids: Li<sup>+</sup>, Al<sup>3+</sup>
	Hard bases: F<sup>-</sup>, O<sup>2-</sup>, NH<sub>3</sub>, PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup>

- Large atomic size( and more negative charge) means "soft"
	
	Soft acids: Hg<sup>2+</sup>, Ti<sup>+</sup>
	Soft bases: S<sup>2-</sup>, I<sup>-</sup>


- Compared to Oxygen, Sulfur is soft.
