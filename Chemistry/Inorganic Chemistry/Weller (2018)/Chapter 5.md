### Brønsted-Lowry Theory of Acids and Bases:

-   Acid: a substance that donates a proton (H+)
-   Base: a substance that accepts a proton (H+)
-   Acid-Base reaction: a reaction in which an acid donates a proton to a base, resulting in the formation of a conjugate base and a conjugate acid

	 - A Brønsted acid is a proton donor. 
		 
		 e.g. Hydrogen fluoride
		 HF(g) + H<sub>2</sub>O(l) → H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup>(aq) + F<sup>-</sup>(aq)
		 
	 - A Brønsted base is a proton acceptor.
	   
	   e.g. Ammonia
	   H<sub>2</sub>O(l) + NH<sub>3</sub>(aq) → NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>(aq) + OH<sup>-</sup>(aq)

### Amphiprotic Substances:

-   Can act as both a Brønsted acid and a Brønsted base
-   Can donate a proton (H<sup>+</sup>) when in the presence of a stronger base
-   Can accept a proton (H<sup>+</sup>) when in the presence of a stronger acid

### Proton in Water

-   When an acid donates a proton to a water molecule, it forms a hydronium ion, H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup> (1; dimensions from crystal structure of H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup>ClO<sub>4</sub><sup>–</sup>).
-   H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup> is an oversimplified representation of a proton in water, which actually participates in extensive hydrogen bonding (Sections 5.8 and 10.6).
-   A more accurate representation of a proton in water is H<sub>9</sub>O<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> (2).
-   In gas-phase studies of water clusters using mass spectrometry, a cage of H<sub>2</sub>O molecules can condense around one H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup> ion in a regular pentagonal dodecahedral arrangement, resulting in the formation of the species H<sup>+</sup>(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>21</sub>.
-   The most appropriate description of a proton in water varies according to the environment and experiment under consideration, but for simplicity, the representation H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup> is used throughout.

### Proton Transfer in Acids and Bases in Aqueous Solution

Proton transfer between acids and bases in aqueous solution is rapid in both directions, resulting in dynamic equilibria. The following reactions are examples of dynamic equilibria in acid-base chemistry in aqueous solution:

#### Equilibrium 1

-   HF(aq) + H<sub>2</sub>O(l) ⇌ H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup>(aq) + F<sup>-</sup>(aq)

#### Equilibrium 2

-   H<sub>2</sub>O(l) + NH<sub>3</sub>(aq) ⇌ NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>(aq) + OH<sup>-</sup>(aq)

The complete description of the behavior of the acid HF and the base NH<sub>3</sub> in water is provided by the dynamic equilibria instead of the forward reactions alone. The central feature of Brønsted acid-base chemistry in aqueous solution is the rapid attainment of equilibrium in the proton-transfer reaction.
