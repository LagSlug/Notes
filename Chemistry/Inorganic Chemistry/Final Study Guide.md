## Constants and Formulas

### Electron Volts

- Measured in kilojoules per mol.
$$ 1eV = 96.685~ \frac {kJ}{mol} $$
## Ancillary Terms

### Quantum Mechanics

- <u>Pauli exclusion principle</u>: no two electrons have the same four quantum numbers.
	- An orbital can have at most two electrons, each of opposing spin.

- <u>Hund's Rule</u>: electrons spread between orbitals of relative energy, before pairing up.

### Nuclear Charges

- <u>Nuclear charge</u> refers to the total positive charge of the protons in the nucleus of an atom, which determines the overall positive charge of the atom.
- The <u>shielding effect</u> reduces the effective nuclear charge on an outer electron by inner electrons, thus shielding it from the full positive charge of the nucleus.

### Molecular Charges

- <u>Molecular charges</u> refer to the distribution of electrical charge within a molecule, which can be positive, negative, or neutral.
- <u>Ions</u> are electrically charged particles that form when an atom gains or loses one or more electrons.
- <u>Cations</u> are positively charged ions. 
- <u>Anions</u> are negatively charged ions.
- <u>Dipole moments</u> refer to the separation of electrical charges within a molecule due to the unequal sharing of electrons between two atoms.

### Bonding

- <u>Ionic bonding</u> is a type of chemical bond that results from the electrostatic attraction between positively and negatively charged ions.
- <u>Covalent bonding</u> is a type of chemical bonding where two or more atoms share electrons in order to form a stable molecule.
- <u>Metallic bonding</u> refers to the electrostatic attraction between positively charged metal ions and a sea of delocalized electrons.
- <u>Hydrogen bonding</u> is a type of intermolecular bonding that occurs between a hydrogen atom bonded to an electronegative element and a lone pair of electrons on another electronegative atom.

### Phases

- Solid, gas, liquid, plasma.

### Thermodynamics

#### Enthalpy

- <u>Enthalpy</u> $(H)$is a thermodynamic property that represents the total heat content of a system at constant pressure. 
- It represents the internal energy of a system, and represents work done on or by the system.
- It is a <u>state function</u>, meaning its value depends only on the current state of the system and not on the path taken to reach that state.
- Can describe heat transfer in chemical reactions and phase changes.


- <u>Heat of Reaction</u> $(ΔH)$ is a change in enthalpy related to some chemical reaction.
	- It represents the energy released or absorbed during this process.
	- A positive value for $ΔH$ indicates that energy is absorbed (endothermic) 
	- A negative value for $ΔH$ indicates that energy is released (exothermic).

- <u>Endothermic</u>: when a change absorbs energy from its surroundings.
	- Chills surroundings.
	- Positive $ΔH$.
	
- <u>Exothermic</u>: when a change releases energy into its surroundings.
	- Heats surroundings.
	- Negative $ΔH$.
	  
- <u>Endothermic reaction</u>: products have higher energy than the reactants, and the overall change in enthalpy is positive.

## Atomic Properties

```
"If you go on with this nuclear arms race, all you are going to do is make the rubble bounce."
― Winston Churchill
```

### Electron Affinity

- Electron affinity is the energy change that occurs when an atom or ion in the gaseous state gains an electron to form a negatively charged ion. 
- It represents the tendency of an atom to accept an additional electron.
  
<u>Electron affinity values can be either positive or negative.</u>

- A positive value indicates that energy is released when an electron is added (exothermic).
- A negative value indicates that energy must be supplied to add an electron (endothermic).

- $ΔH$ is the heat 
- Defined in gas phase:
$$
\displaylines{
 Cl_{(g)} + e^- \rightarrow Cl^-_{(g)} \\ \\
 ΔH = -349 \frac {kJ} {mol}
}
$$

### Electronegativity

- <u>Electronegativity</u> is the measure of an atom's ability to attract and hold onto electrons in a chemical bond, indicating its relative attraction for shared electrons. 
- It is typically represented by <u>Pauling's electronegativity scale</u>.
- Increases from left to right.
- Decreases from top to bottom.
- Always a positive value.

- Electronegativity <u>can be used to assign oxidation states</u> of elements in a compound.

![[Chemistry/Inorganic Chemistry/attachments/f-d 5f4bf7508b07cbc8a8b995c5c6d2be749b19829f2abc12d32be37dc9+IMAGE+IMAGE.jpg]]

- Noble gases have low electronegativity values since they have a stable electron configuration.
- Transition metals have variable electronegativity values due to their multiple oxidation states.
- Electronegativity tends to be higher for nonmetals compared to metals.

### Ionic Radius
- <u>Ionic radius</u> refers to the size of an ion, which is the measure of the distance from the nucleus to the outermost electron in an ion. 
- It is influenced by the nuclear charge, electron-electron repulsion, and the presence of additional electrons or electron loss.

<u>The ionic radius increases with an increase in the coordination number</u>:
- Increased coordination number means more ligands or ions surrounding the central ion.
- More ligands lead to higher electron-electron repulsion.
- To maintain stability, the central ion adopts a larger ionic radius, allowing for better spacing of ligands, reducing electron-electron repulsion.

### Effective Nuclear Charge

- The <u>effective nuclear charge</u> is the net positive charge experienced by an electron, obtained by subtracting the shielding effect from the actual nuclear charge.
- It considers both nucleus attraction and electron repulsion.
- <u>Always positive</u>.
- Increases from left to right
- Decreases from from top to bottom.

![[Chemistry/Inorganic Chemistry/attachments/Effective Nuclear Charge.png]]

### Atomic Radii

- As nuclear charge increases within the nucleus, the outermost electrons are more strongly attracted, causing the atomic radius to shrink.

![[Chemistry/Inorganic Chemistry/attachments/imageedit_14_2424312021.jpg]]

- Atomic radii decrease from:
  1. left to right, across a row
  2. bottom to top, up a column
  
- The smallest atom is at the top right.
- The largest atom is at the bottom left.

### Ionization Energy

- <u>Ionization energy</u> is the amount of energy required to remove an electron from an isolated gaseous atom or ion, resulting in the formation of a positively charged ion.
  
- Increases from left to right.
- Decreases from top to bottom.
  
- The <u>first ionization energy is always positive</u>.
- Removing a valence electron becomes easier as the size of an atom grows, and the effective nuclear charge it feels decreases.
- Defined in gas phase:
$$
\displaylines{
 Li_{(g)} \rightarrow Li^+_{(g)} + e^- \\
 E_{Li}
}
$$

## Electronic Properties

```
“I find the idea quite intolerable that an electron exposed to radiation should choose of its own free will not only its moment to jump off but its direction. In that case I would rather be a cobbler, or even an employee in a gaming house, than a physicist.”
― Albert Einstein 
```

### Quantum Numbers

- Three quanum numbers are needed to describe a single electron orbital.
- Four quantum numbers are needed to describe the position of an electron.

- Subshells vary in energy level:
$$s ~> ~p~ > ~d ~\approx~ f $$
  
#### 3. Magnetic $(m_ℓ)$

$$
### Electronic Configurations

- Electron configurations refer to the arrangement of electrons within orbitals of an atom.
- Orbitals within subshells are filled given a pattern related to electronegativities.

![[Chemistry/Inorganic Chemistry/attachments/subshell-trend.svg]]

<u>To obtain an electron configuration</u>:
1. Find number of electrons in a neutral atom, which is equal to its atomic number $(Z)$.
2. Fill in orbitals, starting from $1s$, according to the pattern above.
3. Replace segments with their equivalent nobel gas configuration.

## Molecular Properties

- Molecules are like two old people fighting over a laminated bingo card.
  
### Paramagentic (unpaired) and Diamagnetic (all paired) Molecules

- <u>Paramagentic</u> atoms and molecules have unpaired electrons.
- <u>Diamagentic</u> atoms and molecules do not have unpaired electrons.

- <u>Must build a Molecular Orbital Diagram</u> to determine if there are unpaired electrons.
- <u>Lewis dot structures do not have enough information</u> to tell if there are unpaired electrons.

#### Example: $O^2$ is paramagentic

- A Lewis dot structure for $O^2$ makes it seem like all electrons are paired, <u>but this is not the case</u>.

![[Chemistry/Inorganic Chemistry/attachments/O2-dot_diagram.jpg]]

- The molecular orbital diagram shows that <u>there are 2 unpaired electrons</u> in the $π^*$ (anti-bonding) orbital, so $O^2$ is paramagnetic.

![[Chemistry/Inorganic Chemistry/attachments/O2-molecular-orbital-diagram-theory.jpg]]

#### Isoelectronic

- Atom, ions, or molecules are <u>isoelectronic</u> if they have the same number of electrons,
  (regardless of their nuclear charges or element).
- $F^{-}$ and $O^{2-}$ are isoelectronic.
  
### X-ray Diffraction

- <u>X-ray diffraction</u> (XRD) can help find the molecular structure of a crystal. 
- A beam of X-rays diffract through the crystal into many directions, making a <u>diffraction pattern</u>. 
- The diffraction pattern is then used to find the positions of atoms within the crystal.

- X-ray diffraction is <u>not useful</u> for finding the radius of an ion.
  


## Reactions

```
"For every action, there is a reaction. And a pikey reaction is quite a fucking thing." 
  ― Snatch (2000)
```

### Lewis Acids and Bases

- In Lewis theory:
	1. <u>Lewis acids</u> are molecules that can accept a pair of electrons.
	   (Lewis acids are electron acceptors.) 
	2. <u>Lewis bases</u> are molecules that can donate a pair of electrons.
	   (Lewis bases are electron doners.)

- Lewis acid-base reactions form coordinate covalent bonds.

#### <u>Example</u>

$$
\text{HCl}_{(aq)} + \text{NaOH}_{(aq)} \rightarrow \text{NaCl}_{(aq)} + \text{H}2\text{O}_{(l)}
$$
- $\text{HCl}$ is a strong acid and dissociates completely into $\text{H}^+$ and $\text{Cl}^-$ ions
- $\text{NaCl}$ is an ionic compound and dissociates completley into $\text{Na}^+$ and $\text{OH}^-$ ions.
- $\text{H}^+$ is a lewis acid, and accepts an electron from the hydroxide ion.
- $\text{OH}^-$ is a lewis base, and donates an electron to the hydronium ion.
- The electron is now shared between the lewis acid and base, which constitutes bond formation.
- The $\text{Na}^+$ and $\text{Cl}^-$ ions are bystanders.

### Hard and Soft Acids and Bases

- <u>The Hard-Soft Acid-Base</u> (HSAB) principle classifies acids and bases as either "hard" or "soft" based on their electronic and molecular properties.
	1. <u>Hard acids and bases</u> are small species, highly charged, and have high electronegativity.
	   - Difficult to polarize electronic field.
	2. <u>Soft acids and bases</u> are larger, less charged, and have lower electronegativity.
	   - Easy to polarize electronic field.
	3. Hard-soft acids and bases <u>will prefer to interact with their own type</u>:
	   - Hard acids prefer hard bases
	   - Soft acids prefer soft bases

### Metathesis (Double Replacement)

- <u>Metathesis reactions</u> involve the interchange of ions between reactant compounds.
	- Cations and anions of two compounds switch places, forming two new compounds.
	- Occurs in aqueous solutions.
	- Often driven by the formation of a precipitate, gas, or a more stable compound.

#### <u>Example</u>

$$
\text{AgNO}_{3(aq)} + \text{NaCl}_{(aq)} 
\rightarrow 
\text{AgCl}_{(s)} + \text{NaNO}_{3(aq)}
$$

- Solid $\text{AgCl}$ precipitates from the reaction of silver nitrate and sodium chloride in an aqueous solution.
- Sodium nitrate is also formed and remains soluble.

## Intermolecular Forces

### Van der Waals Force

- <u>Van der Waals forces</u> are weak attractive forces between molecules resulting from temporary dipole moments induced by the fluctuation and movement of local electron density.
  
- The temporary dipole in one molecule can attract nearby molecules with complementary dipoles.
  
- <u>London dispersion forces</u> are a type of Van der Waals force that arises from the temporary fluctuation of electron density in nonpolar molecules, resulting in an induced dipole that can attract neighboring molecules.
  
- Important in molecules with non-polar covalent bonds, where other attractive forces such as the stronger dipole-dipole interactions do not occur (except temporarily through induction).

### Electrostatic Force

- <u>Electrostatic force</u> is the attractive or repulsive force between electrically charged particles.
- Opposite charges are attracted.
- Like charges are repulsed.
- Charges are either <u>positive</u> or <u>negative</u>.
  
### Sigma (σ) Bonding

- A <u>sigma</u> (σ) bond is a covalent bond formed by the overlap of atomic orbitals along the internuclear axis of two atoms.
  
<u>Properties</u>
1. Cylindrical symmetry around the bond axis.
2. Can form between:
	- two s orbitals
	- two p orbitals
	- one s orbital and one p orbital
3. Typically form in single bonds.

###  Pi (π) Bonding

- A <u>pi</u> (π) bond is a type of covalent bond formed by the overlap of parallel p orbitals perpendicular to the internuclear axis of two atoms.

<u>Properties</u>
1. Non-cyclindrical symmetry.
2. Can only form between parallel p orbitals.
3. Weaker than sigma bonds.
  
### Resonance

- <u>Resonance</u> involves the delocalization of electrons within a molecule or ion.
- It occurs when multiple Lewis structures can be drawn that differ only in the arrangement of electrons while maintaining the same positions of atoms.
- Resonance involves the shifting or sharing of pi bonds or lone pairs of electrons among adjacent atoms.
- The actual structure of the molecule is a hybrid of all the resonance structures, with electrons being spread out or delocalized.
- Resonance enhances stability, affects reactivity, and influences properties such as bond lengths and electron distribution.
- It is commonly observed in organic compounds with conjugated systems, such as aromatic compounds like benzene.
  

## Molecular Models

* <u>Molecular orbital theory</u> provides a comprehensive explanation of bonding and structure, surpassing other models like valence bond theory. It accounts for resonance and delocalization of electrons.

### Molecular Orbitals

* <u>Molecular orbitals</u> represent regions in a molecule with high electron probability.
* They form through the combination of <u>atomic orbitals</u> using the LCAO method.
* Two types exist: <u>bonding orbitals</u> (lower energy) and <u>antibonding orbitals</u> (higher energy).
* Bonding orbitals result from in-phase combination, attracting electrons between nuclei.
* Antibonding orbitals form from out-of-phase combination, repelling electrons away from nuclei.
* Energy levels are depicted in <u>molecular orbital diagrams</u>, with electrons filling from lower to higher energy levels.
* <u>Sigma (σ)</u> and <u>pi (π) orbitals</u> categorize molecular orbitals based on their symmetry and overlap.
* Each orbital can hold a maximum of two electrons with opposite spins, following the <u>Pauli exclusion principle</u>.

### Linear Combination of Atomic Orbitals (LCAO)

- A linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO) is a mathematical approach used to describe the molecular orbitals in a molecule as a combination of atomic orbitals from the constituent atoms. 
- It involves:
	1. adding or subtracting atomic orbitals 
	2. adjusting their coefficients to form molecular orbitals.

<u>Key points</u>

- LCAO is based on the interference of atomic orbitals to form molecular orbitals.
- Atomic orbitals combine with coefficients to create molecular orbitals.
- This combination produces bonding and antibonding orbitals.
- Coefficients determine the contribution of each atomic orbital.
- LCAO predicts molecular orbital energy, shape, and electron distribution.
- It is commonly used to explain bonding and electronic structure in molecules.

### Symmetry-Adapted Linear Combinations (SALCs)

- <u>Symmetry-Adapted Linear Combinations</u> (SALCs) are linear combinations of atomic orbitals (LCAOs) that are constructed to match the symmetry of molecular orbitals in a molecule
- By combining atomic orbitals according to the symmetry the molecule, SALCs form molecular orbitals that preserve the overall symmetry of the system.

### Point Groups

- <u>Point groups</u> are sets of symmetry operations that when applied to a molecule, result in the same spacial arrangement.

### Character Tables

- A <u>character table</u> is the complete set of irreducible representations of a symmetry group.

$$
\begin{array}{l|l} \hline \textbf{Mulliken Labels} & \textbf{meaning}\\ \hline A & \text{singly degenerate (1x1), symmetric to principle axis} \\ B & \text{singly degenerate (1x1), antisymmetric to principle axis} \\ E & \text{doubly degenerate (2x2)} \\ T & \text{triply degenerate (3x3)} \\ \hline \textbf{Subscripts and superscripts} & \textbf{meaning} \\ \hline 1 & \text{symmetric to } \sigma_v \text{or perpendicular to } C_2 \\ 2 & \text{anti-symmetric to } \sigma_v \text{or perpendicular to } C_2 \\ g & \text{symmetric to inversion center} \\ u & \text{anti-symmetric to inversion center} \\ ' & \text{symmetric to } \sigma_h \\ " & \text{anti-symmetric to } \sigma_h \\ \hline \end{array}
$$

### Reducible Representations

- <u>Reducible representations</u> are decomposable representations of a group that can be further broken down into irreducible representations.
- They represent the availble symmetries of an individual orbital.

<u>To calculate</u>:

1. Determine point group of molecule.
2. Assign x, y, and z axes.
   - z-axis is aligned to the principal axis of the central atom.
   - y-axis of each ligand in a non-linear molecule points toward the central atom.
3. Draw orbitals of the outer atoms.
4. Apply each point group operation to the molecule, and summarize the changes to its orbitals:
	- $0$ = orbital changes position
	- $1$ = orbital does not change position
	- $-1$ = orbital sign changes, but does not change position.

$$
a = \frac{1}{h} \sum_{g} n(g) \chi(g) \chi'(g)
$$
where:
- $h$ is the order of the group (total number of symmetry operations).
- $g$ is a particular symmetry operation.
- $n(g)$ is the number of times operation g appears in the group.
- $\chi(g)$ is the character of the reducible representation for operation $g$.
- $\chi'(g)$ is the character of the irreducible representation for operation $g$.

### Potential Energies of Orbitals

![[Chemistry/Inorganic Chemistry/attachments/orbital potential energy vs atomic number.png]]

- Orbitals with a $Δ_{eV}\approx 14.4eV$ or greater are not close enough in energy to form bonds.
- When two orbitals are very far apart in energy, one of them will always "win" in the 

### Molecular Orbital Diagram

- A <u>molecular orbital diagram</u> is a graphical representation that shows the relative energy levels and electron occupancy of the molecular orbitals in a molecule.

- Two general methods for construction: 
	1. <u>by inspection</u> - looking at symmetries through drawings and determining which orbitals will interact.
	2. <u>by representations</u> - using the reducible and irreducible representations of symmetries, calculated potential energies of orbitals, and the projection operator method to magically determine which orbitals will interact.

#### Building by Inspection

- Build molecular orbitals through the Linear Combination of Atomic Orbitals.
	- LCAO process: 
		1. Combine compatible orbitals from atom A to atom B to produce an equal number of molecular orbitals.
		2. draw two molecular orbitals:
			- Bonding orbital: higher in energy than both atomic orbitals from A and B.
			- Anti-bonding orbital: lower energy than both atomic orbitals from A and B.
		1. one called "bonding" which is deeper in energy than both of the origthe other called "antibonding".
- Count valence electrons in each participating atom.
- Add those valence electrons to molecular orbitals according to Hund's Rule and the Pauli Exclusion Principle.
	- Hund's Rule: electrons spread between orbitals of relative energy, before pairing up.
	- Pauli Exclusion Principle: two electrons per orbitial limit, must have opposite spins.

#### Building by Representations

1. Build reducible representations.
2. Reduce the reducible representations.
3. Find matching orbital symmetries between the central atom and ligand.
4. Check if orbitals are very different in energies.

#### Example: $\text{CO}$ - Carbon Monoxide

- Can be done directly, by inspection.

\right] &&=0 \\
\\
Γ_{1s} &= A1 + B1
\end{aligned}
$$

- A1 and B1 symmetries are available.

#### Example: $\text{BH}_3$ - Borane

![[Chemistry/Inorganic Chemistry/Exam 2/attachments/MO Diagram BH3.png]]

- The $1e'$ molecular orbitals are degenerate, because both orbitals have the same energy.

#### Example: $\text{BF}_3$ - Boron trifluoride

![[Chemistry/Inorganic Chemistry/attachments/Boron trifluride mo diagram.png]]

- $A'_2$ and $E''$ are non-bonding orbitals due to incompatible symmetries.
- The $2s$ orbitals from the flurine atoms are too different in energy to interact with boron.

## Energy and Stability

### Transition Metal d-orbitals

- The d-subshell has 5 orbitals:
	- $3d_{z^2}~\text{and}~3d_{x^2-y^2}$ are doubly degenerate (2 orbitals of equal energy).
	- $3d_{xy},~3d_{xz},~\text{and}~3d_{yz}$ are triply degenerate (3 orbitals of equal energy).

![[Chemistry/Inorganic Chemistry/attachments/Five-d-orbitals-in-a-cubic-crystal-field-which-split-into-two-e-g-orbitals-and.png]]

- $E_g$ orbitals are:
	- $(E)$ Doubly dengenerate
	- $(g)$ Symmetric to inversion center

- $T_{2g}$ orbitals are:
	- $(T)$ Triply dengenerate
	- $(2)$ Anti-symmetric to $σ_v$ or perpendicular to $C_2$
	- $(g)$ Symmetric to inversion center

### Crystal Field Splitting

- <u>Crystal Field Splitting</u> occurs when ligands cause electrostatic interactions that push the $e_g$ and $t_{2g}$ d-orbitals apart in energy.
  
- This splitting arises due to the repulsion or attraction between the metal ion and the ligands, leading to the redistribution of electron density, resulting in different energy levels for the d-orbitals.

- <u>Crystal Field Stabilization Energy</u> (CFSE) refers to the energy difference caused by splitting.

$$
CFSE=\Delta{E}=E_{\text{ligand field}} - E_{\text{isotropic field}}
$$
- $Δ_o$ - Octahedral CFSE.
- $Δ_t$ - Tetrahedral CFSE.


![[Chemistry/Inorganic Chemistry/attachments/clipboard_e3082d8adaae5b7b28873cc2fbb88a183.png]]


### Ligand Strength

- Weak field ligands cause a small splitting, which leads to high spin.
- Strong field ligands cause a large splitting, which leads to low spin.

<u>Trend of ligand strengths</u>

$$
I^- < \text{Br}^- < \text{Cl}^- < \text{SCN}^- < \text{F}^- < \text{OH}^- < \text{ox}^{2-} < \text{ONO}^- < \text{H}_2\text{O} < \text{SCN}^- < \text{EDTA}^{4-} < \text{NH}_3 < \text{en} < \text{NO}_2^- < \text{CN}^-
$$

### Pairing and Excitation Energy

- <u>Pairing energy</u> is the energy required to place (pair) two electrons into the same orbital.
- <u>Excitation energy</u> is the energy required to promote an electron from its ground state orbital to the next highest orbital.
- When pairing energy is greater than excitation energy, electrons will be promoted instead of pairing.

### High Spin

- <u>Pairing up is less energetically favorable</u>, so the $d$ orbital will fill with unpaired electrons and then place electrons into a higher orbital before pairing electrons in the $d$ orbital.

$$
Δ_o < \text{Pairing Energy} \rightarrow \text{High Spin}
$$

- Costs more energy to pair up then it does to promote.

### Low Spin

- <u>Pairing up is more energetically favorable</u>, so the $d$ orbital will be filled with paired electrons before placing electrons into a higher orbital.

$$
Δ_o > \text{Pairing Energy} \rightarrow \text{Low Spin}
$$
- Costs more energy to promote than it does to pair up.

### Determining Spin

- <u>Small splitting causes high spin</u>, because electrons are promoted to a higher energy orbital instead of pairing.
- <u>Large splitting causes low spin</u>, because electron pairing is more favorable than electron promotion.

- Find:
	1. The electron count of the d sub-shell in the complex.
	2. The oxidation state of the metal ion.
	   
- Consider the ligand field strength of the surrounding ligands. 
	1. higher spin - Weak-field ligands cause less splitting.
	2. lower spin - Strong-field ligands cause greater splitting.

- Compare the number of d-electrons with available d-orbitals.
	1. higher spin - the number of d-electrons is less than or equal to half the number of available d-orbitals.
	   (5 in a transition metal complex)
	2. lower spin - the number of d-electrons exceeds half the number of available d-orbitals.

- Strong-field ligands typically promote low spin configurations, while weak-field ligands favor high spin configurations.
- Consider ligand geometry and electron pairing energy that may influence the spin state.

### Octahedral CFSE - $Δ_o$

$$
CFSE =  \frac 3 5n(e_g)Δ_o - \frac 2 5 n(t_{2g})Δ_o
$$
- where:
	- $n(t_{2g})$ and $n(e_g)$ are the number of electrons in the $t_{2g}$ and $e_g$ orbitals respectively.
	- $Δ_o$ is the octahedral splitting parameter.

### Tetrahedral CFSE - $Δ_t$

- Late transition metals with strong field ligands tend to be tetrahedral.

$$
CFSE =  \frac 2 5n(e)Δ_t - \frac 3 5 n(t_{2})Δ_t
$$
- where:
	- $n(t_{2})$ and $n(e_g)$ are the number of electrons in the $t_{2}$ and $e_g$ orbitals respectively.
	- $Δ_t$ is the tetrahedral splitting parameter.

-  $Δ_t$ is typically smaller than pairing energy, so tetrahedral complexes are usually high spin.

### Conversion between $Δ_o$ and $Δ_t$

- Tetrahedral splitting constant
$$
\Delta_{t} = \frac 4 9\,\Delta_o
$$

- $Δ_t$ is less than $Δ_o$ for the same ligands.


### Examples
#### Example: $\ce{[Ni(CO)4]}$ - Tetrahedral

1. Look up Nickel Carbonyl and find out what geometry it has.

![[Chemistry/Inorganic Chemistry/attachments/sdZA2.jpg]]

2. Find the appropriate crystal field splitting diagram for tetrahedral geometry.
   
![[Chemistry/Inorganic Chemistry/attachments/tetrahedral splitting.png]]

3. In coordination compounds the $s$ electrons move to the $d$ sub-shell in bonding.
$$
\ce{[Ar]}4s^2 3d^8 \implies \ce{[Ar]}3d^{10}
$$

4. Place electrons on diagram.
  
  ![[Chemistry/Inorganic Chemistry/attachments/tetrahedral splitting - with electrons.png]]

5. Determine $Δ_t$.

- $e_g \ (d_{x^2-y^2},\ d_{z^2}) \ E=-\frac{3}{5}\Delta_\textrm{t}$
- $t_{2g} \ (d_{xy},\ d_{xz},\ d_{yz}) \ E=\frac{2}{5}\Delta_\textrm{t}$

$$
\Delta E = 4\times\left(-\frac{3}{5}\Delta_\textrm{t}\right)+6\times\left(\frac{2}{5}\Delta_\textrm{t}\right)=0
$$

&=( -9/5\Delta_o + 3P ) - 2P \nonumber
\\ \\
&=-9/5 \Delta_o + P \nonumber
