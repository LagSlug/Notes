2) Complete this Table:
   
|   | Crystal System          | Lattice dimensions               | Arity | Required Parameters |
|:-:|-------------------------|----------------------------------|:-----:|---------------------|
| 1 | Cubic                   | a = b = c, α = β = γ = 90°       |   1   | a                   |

- If the third axis is perpendicular to the ones you just drew, what crystal system do you have for each picture?

4) At 20°C, elemental iron is bcc, **a = 2.866 Å**. At 950 °C, Fe is ccp, **a = 3.43 Å**. 
   At each temperature, calculate:
   a) the density of iron,
   b) the metallic radius of iron atoms.

5) Please show that the optimized radius ratio for the coordination number 4 is 0.225.

6) Calculate the density of tungsten (bcc, *a* = 315 pm).
