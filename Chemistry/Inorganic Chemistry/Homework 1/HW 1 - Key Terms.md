Endothermic

-   Absorbs energy
-   Has a positive value (energy is added to the system)

Exothermic

-   Releases energy
-   Has a negative value (energy is released from the system)

Ionic Radius

-   Refers to the size of an ion in a crystal lattice.
-   Increases with an increase in the coordination number.

Covalent Radius

-   Refers to the size of an atom in a covalent bond.
-   Independent of the bond order.

Atomic Radius

-   Refers to the size of an atom.
-   May or may not have the same meaning as ionic radius, depending on the context.

Anions

-   Refers to negatively charged ions.
-   Have a smaller size compared to the radius of the corresponding neutral atom.

Formal Charge:

-   It is defined as the difference between the number of valence electrons an atom has in its neutral state and the number of valence electrons assigned to it in the molecule or ion.
-   Formal charge helps in determining the most likely distribution of electrons in a molecule and predicting its reactivity.
-   The sum of formal charges in a neutral molecule should be zero.

Oxidation States:

-   A concept used in chemistry to describe the number of electrons that an atom has lost or gained in a chemical species.
-   It is expressed as a positive or negative number.
-   A positive oxidation state indicates that an atom has lost electrons, and a negative oxidation state indicates that an atom has gained electrons.
-   Oxidation states help in determining the electron transfer reactions and in assigning oxidation numbers to elements in a molecule.
-   The sum of oxidation states in a neutral molecule should be zero.

Electronegativity:

-   Always postitive.
-   A measure of an atom's ability to attract electrons towards itself in a chemical bond
-   Indicates the relative strength of an atom's electron-pulling power in a molecule
-   Used to predict the distribution of electrons in a molecule and the type of chemical bond that will form between atoms
-   Higher electronegativity values indicate a stronger ability to attract electrons, while lower electronegativity values indicate a weaker ability to attract electrons

First Ionization Energy:

-   Always positive (endothermic).
-   Energy is always required to remove the most loosely bound electron from a neutral atom in the gaseous state
-   Indicates the strength of an atom's electron-holding power
-   Higher first ionization energy values indicate a stronger hold on electrons and a greater electronegativity
-   Typically, elements with higher first ionization energy are more electronegative, as they have a stronger pull on electrons in a chemical bond

First Electron Affinity:

-   Can be negative (exothermic) or positive (endothermic).
-   A negative value indicates an exothermic change, where energy is released by the system.
-   A positive value indicates an endothermic change, where energy must be added to the system.
-   The energy change associated with adding an electron to a neutral atom to form a negative ion
-   Indicates the energy change that occurs when an electron is added to an atom
-   Does not necessarily have a direct relationship with electronegativity

Oxidation State:

-   The charge an atom would have if all bonds to atoms of different elements were 100% ionic
-   Used to indicate the degree of oxidation (loss of electrons) or reduction (gain of electrons) of an element in a chemical compound
-   Electronegativity can be used to assign oxidation states, but it is not the only factor that determines oxidation states. Other factors such as the relative size and electron configuration of the atoms in a molecule also play a role in determining the oxidation states.

Effective Nuclear Charge:

-   A measure of the net positive charge experienced by an electron in an atomic orbital, taking into account the shielding effect of other electrons.
-   Determined by subtracting the average shielding effect from the total charge of the nucleus.
-   Dependent on the electron's distance from the nucleus and the number of electrons in the atom.
-   Higher effective nuclear charge leads to stronger attractive force, lower electron energy, and smaller atomic radius.
-   An important concept in understanding atomic behavior and trends in the periodic table.

Diamagnetic:

-   Refers to materials that are not attracted to a magnetic field.
-   Does not have any unpaired electrons, resulting in a weak or negligible response to a magnetic field.
-   Examples of diamagnetic materials include the noble gases (helium, neon, argon, etc.), copper, gold, and silver.
-   Diamagnetic materials are considered non-magnetic and are often used as a reference point in magnetic studies.

Paramagnetic:

-   Refers to materials that are weakly attracted to a magnetic field.
-   Contains unpaired electrons, which result in a non-zero magnetic moment and a weak response to a magnetic field.
-   Examples of paramagnetic materials include some metals (such as iron, cobalt, and nickel), free radicals, and ions such as oxygen (O2+).
-   Paramagnetic materials are considered weakly magnetic and have a small, positive magnetic susceptibility.

Ferromagnetic:

-   Refers to materials that have a strong attraction to a magnetic field.
-   Contains a large number of unpaired electrons, which result in a strong magnetic moment and a strong response to a magnetic field.
-   Examples of ferromagnetic materials include iron, cobalt, nickel, and some alloys.
-   Ferromagnetic materials are used in various applications such as magnetic storage devices and electric motors.

Molecular Orbital (MO) Theory:

-   Describes how electrons are distributed in molecules.
-   Molecular orbitals are formed by the combination of atomic orbitals, and are classified as bonding or anti-bonding based on their contributions to the overall stability of the molecule.
-   Predicts stability and reactivity based on electron distribution.
-   Can also predict magnetic properties (diamagnetic, paramagnetic, or ferromagnetic).
-   Based on quantum mechanics.

Aufbau Principle:

-   Electrons occupy the lowest energy level available to them.
-   Electrons fill orbitals in order of increasing energy levels, starting from the lowest level.
-   The electrons are placed in orbitals one at a time, with spins paired to obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle.
-   The filling of orbitals continues until all electrons in an atom have been accounted for.

Pauli Exclusion Principle:

-   No two electrons in an atom can have the same set of quantum numbers.
-   Only two electrons can occupy a single orbital, and these two electrons must have opposite spins.

Bonding and Anti-bonding Orbitals:

-   Bonding orbitals are created when two atomic orbitals combine and create a lower energy molecular orbital
-   The electrons in bonding orbitals are lower in energy and more stable than the individual atomic orbitals
-   Bonding orbitals contribute to the stability and strength of a chemical bond
-   Anti-bonding orbitals are formed when two atomic orbitals combine, but result in a higher energy molecular orbital
-   The electrons in anti-bonding orbitals are higher in energy and less stable than the individual atomic orbitals
-   Anti-bonding orbitals do not contribute to bond formation and can weaken or break bonds.

Bond Order:

-   A measure of the stability of a bond between two atoms
-   Reflects the number of bonds between two atoms in a molecule
-   Can be used to predict the strength of a bond and stability of a molecule
-   Bond order = (number of bonding electrons - number of antibonding electrons) / 2

Valence Electrons:

-   The outermost electrons in an atom.
-   The electrons involved in chemical bonding.
-   The electrons that determine an atom's reactivity.
-   The number of valence electrons can be calculated by counting the electrons in the highest occupied energy level of the atom.

-   Proposed by Swedish chemist Svante Arrhenius in 1887.

Hofmann Bibliographic Theory:

-   States that an acid is any substance that can release a proton

Bronsted-Lowry Theory:

-   Acid: substance that donates a proton (H+)
-   Base: substance that accepts a proton
-   Acid-base reaction: transfer of a proton from an acid to a base
-   Acid strength: determined by its tendency to donate a proton
-   Base strength: determined by its ability to accept a proton

Lewis Acids and Bases:

-   Lewis acids are electron pair acceptors
-   Lewis bases are electron pair donors
-   Acids and bases interact through dative bonds
-   In Lewis theory, acids and bases can be any species, not just H+ and OH- ions as in Bronsted-Lowry theory.

Zion-Kroenig Theory:

-   Describes acids as electron pair acceptors and bases as electron pair donors
-   Based on the behavior of electron pairs in the outermost shell of atoms or ions
-   Acid-base reactions are seen as transfer of electron pairs from bases to acids

Hard-Soft Acid-Base (HSAB) Theory:

-   Classifies acids and bases into two categories: hard and soft
-   Hard acids and bases have high ionization energy and electron affinity, respectively
-   Soft acids and bases have low ionization energy and electron affinity, respectively
