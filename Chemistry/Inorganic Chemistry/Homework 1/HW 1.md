1. How many electrons can occupy an orbital defined by n= 4, _l_ = 3, and m<sub>l</sub>=3?
		(a) 2	    (b) 6	   (c) 10	(d) 14
		
	- n - principle quantum number, determines the energy and size of the orbital
	- L - angular moment, determines the shape and orientation of the orbital, and must be an integer that is less than the value of n
	- m - magnetic quantum number, dertermines the orientation of an electron's orbital in space, relative to a reference axis. The value of m<sub>l</sub> can range from -L to +L
	- e.g.  when:
			L = 0 => s orbital - 2 e -  sphere 
			L= 1 => p orbital - 6 e -  hourglass
			L= 2 => d orbital - 10 e - four lobes/donut/hourglass
			L = 3 => f orbital - 14 e - similar to d orbital

	Sanity Check:
		- n = 4 means the fourth shell
		- L = 3 means an f orbital, which is valid because L < n
		- m<sub>l</sub> = +3 is valid because it is within the range of -L to +L
		- Therefore,[4, 3, +3] is an orbital in the 4f sub-shell, which can have 14 electrons, however an individual orbital can only have 2 electrons according to the Pauli Exclusion principle.

Answer: A
	The [4, 3, +3] orbital can have 2 electrons at most.


2. Sub-shells such as s, p, d, and f orbitals are designated by the orbital angular momentum quantum number, *l* which ranges from 0 to n-1 for each shell. What is the orbital angular momentum quantum number for the orbital f<sub>xyz</sub>?
		(a) 0  	(b) 1	   (c) 2	   (d) 3

Answer: D
	The f sub-shell is represented by L = 3

3.  1.  Which of the following sets of quantum numbers does NOT correctly specify the state of an electron in an atom?
		(a) n=2, l=1, m<sub>l</sub>=0, s=1/2
		(b) n=3, l=3, m<sub>l</sub>=-2, s=-1/2
		(c) n=4, l=3, m<sub>l</sub>= 3, s=-1/2
		(d) n=5, l=0, m<sub>l</sub>= 0, s=-1/2

	- Check if the spin (s) values are either -1/2 or 1/2
	- Check if any values of m<sub>l</sub> are not between -L and +L
	- Check if any values for L break the L < n rule.
			Answer B has: n = 3 and l = 3, which violates the L < n rule

Answer: B
	L ≠ 3 when n = 3

4. Which is the ground state electron configuration for the element iron in Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>?
		(a) [Ar]3d<sup>6</sup>4s<sup>2</sup>
		(b) [Ar]3d<sup>5</sup> 
		(c) [Ar]3d<sup>6</sup> 
		(d) [Ar]3d<sup>3</sup>4s<sup>2</sup>
		
	- Ground state electron configuration refers to the arrangement of electrons in an atom or ion when it is in its lowest energy state, representing the most stable arrangement of electrons.
	-  Fe in  Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> has an oxidation state of +3, which means it has 3 less electrons than a neutral Fe atom.
	- The GSEC of Fe is [Ar]3d<sup>6</sup>4s<sup>2</sup> 
	- The GSEC of Fe (III) is [Ar]3d<sup>5</sup>
	- Note that electrons are removed from the highest energy orbitals first
	
Answer: B
	
5. If a trivalent metal ion, M<sup>3+</sup>, has an electron configuration of [Xe]4f<sup>14</sup>, which ion is it?
	   (a) La<sup>3+</sup> 
	   (b) Yb<sup>3+</sup>
	   (c) Eu<sup>3+ </sup>
	   (d) Lu<sup>3+</sup>
	   
	- An atom with a root/parent configuration of Xe must be in the 6th period.
	- A neutral M atom would have 14 + 3 electrons in its valence shell.
	- In this atom all of the valence electrons have shifted into the f sub-shell, which leaves the s and s, p, and d sub-shells empty.
	- A neutral Xe has 54 electrons, therefore a neutral M must have 54 + 17 electrons
	- M must have 71 electrons, and therefore 71 protons, so M must be Lutetium (Lu)
	
Answer: D
	[Xe]4f<sup>14</sup> corresponds with Lu<sup>3+</sup> 

Sanity check: 
	- A neutral Lu atom has 71 electrons, Lu<sup>3+</sup> has lost three electrons, and now has 68. A neutral Xe atom has 54 electrons, and represents electrons in non-valence shells. This leaves 14 electrons in a valence shell. By convention the electron configuration of Lu<sup>3+</sup> would have been [Xe]6s<sup>2</sup>5d<sup>6</sup>4f<sup>6</sup> but [Xe]4f<sup>14</sup> is more energetically stable. Therefore [Xe]4f<sup>14</sup> represents  Lu<sup>3+</sup>.

6. Which of the following metal cations is paramagnetic?
		(a) BeF<sub>2</sub>	(b) ZnO	(c) TiF<sub>3</sub>  	(d) CuI

	- paramagnetic properties come from unpaired electrons within an atom	  
		- BeF<sub>2</sub> has two ions, Be<sup>2+</sup> and F<sup>-</sup>, but only Be<sup>2+</sup> is a metal cation.
		- ZnO has the Zn<sup>2+</sup> metal cation
		- TiF3 has the Ti<sup>3+</sup> metal cation
		- CuI has the Cu<sup>+</sup> metal cation
		
		- Be has an electron configuration of [He]2s<sup>2</sup>, so Be<sup>2+</sup> would have an electron configuration of [He] since it has lost two electrons. *With no unpaired electrons, Be<sup>2+</sup> is not paramagnetic.*
		- Zn has an electron configuration of [Ar]3d<sup>10</sup>4s<sup>2</sup>, so Zn<sup>2+</sup> would have an electron configuration of  [Ar]3d<sup>8</sup>4s<sup>2</sup>, and has no unpaired electrons
		- Ti has an electron configuration of [Ar]3d<sup>2</sup>4s<sup>2</sup>, so Ti<sup>3+</sup> would have an electron configuration of [Ar]4s<sup>1</sup>. *Since this ionic species has an unpaired electron, it is paramagnetic.*
		- Cu has an electron configuration of [Ar]3d<sup>9</sup>4s<sup>2</sup>, so Cu<sup>+</sup> would have an electron configuration of [Ar]3d<sup>8</sup>4s<sup>2</sup>, which has no unpaired electrons.
		
Answer: C
	Ti<sup>3+</sup> in TiF<sub>3</sub> is paramagnetic

7. Which of the following can NOT be determined directly by X-ray diffraction (which means an arbitrary decision has to be taken on how to apportion the interatomic distances determined from X-ray diffraction)?
        (a) Metallic radius in Ag metal
        (b) Covalent radius for I in I<sup>2</sup> solid
        (c) Ionic radius of Na<sup>+</sup> in NaCl
        (d) van der Waals radius of I in I<sup>2</sup> solid

	- X-ray diffraction is: 		
	```
	The scattering of radiation with wavelengths of about 100 pm from crystals gives rise to diffraction; the interpretation of the diffraction patterns provides quantitative structural information and in many cases the complete molecular or ionic structure. 

	Crystallographers still generally use the angstrom (1 Å = 10−10 m = 10−8 cm = 10−2 pm) as a unit of measurement. This unit is convenient because bond lengths typically lie between 1 and 3 Å and the X-ray wavelengths used to derive them usually lie between 0.5 and 2.5 Å.
		
	(8.1, page 245)	
	```

	- The diffraction pattern is characteristic of the positions and types of atom present in the crystalline compound.	
	- X-ray diffraction is sensitive to electron-rich atoms in a compoundi due to its dependence on electron interactions with X-ray waves, so in compounds like Pb(OH)<sub>2</sub>, the Pb atom will dominate the diffraction pattern.
	- Positions of hydrogen atoms in inorganic compounds that contain only light atoms (Z < 18, argon) can be determined from diffraction patterns, but their location in compounds with heavy atoms (e.g. 4d- and 5d-series elements) are difficult or impossible to determine.
		- Hydrogen has a very low electron density (reduced further through bonding), and heavy elements have high electron densities.
		- The X-ray-determined position of this bonded hydrogen electron can be displaced along the bond direction, producing bond lengths that are shorter than the true internuclear distance.
		- Note: neutron diffraction can be used to determine the positions of hydrogen atoms in inorganic compounds
	- The metallic radius in Ag metal, the covalent radius for I in I2 solid, and the ionic radius of Na+ in NaCl can be determined by analyzing the diffraction pattern produced by X-rays shining onto the corresponding samples.
	- However, the van der Waals radius is a measure of the size of an atom or molecule taking into account the non-bonded electron cloud, which is not directly obtained from X-ray diffraction data.

~~Answer: D~~ [ Answer was C]
	~~The van der Waals radius of I in I<sup>2</sup> solid cannot be measured through X-ray diffraction.~~

8. Which of the following is True?
        (a) The ionic radius increases with an increase in the coordination number.
        (b) The covalent radius of an atom is independent of the bond order.
        (c) The atomic radius of elements has the same meaning as the ionic radius.
        (d) The size of anions is smaller than the radius of the neutral atom.

	- <u>Ionic radius</u> is the measure of the size of an ion, defined as half the distance between two adjacent ions of the same element in a crystal lattice.
	- The <u>coordination number</u> refers to the number of atoms, ions, or molecules directly bonded to a central atom in a molecule or crystal structure.
	- <u>Covalent radius</u> is a measure of the size of an atom that forms part of one covalent bond.
	- <u>Bond order</u> is the number of chemical bonds between two atoms. It can range from 0 to 3, where 0 represents no bond, and 3 represents a triple bond.
	- The <u>atomic radius</u> of a chemical element is a measure of the size of its atom, usually the mean or typical distance from the center of the nucleus to the outermost isolated electron.
	- An <u>anion</u> is a negative charged ion that forms as a result of an atom gaining on or more electrons.

	(a) True, the increase in coordination number results in the ions moving further away from the central ion to fit more ions
	(b) False, the covalent radius dependant on bond order ()
	(c) False, the ionic radius is not the same as the atomic radius.
	(d) False, due to extra electrons anions are generally larger than a neutral atom of the same type

		(a) O<sub>2</sub>	
		(b) O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>	
		(c) O<sub>2</sub><sup>2-</sup>	
		(d) O<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup>

Answer: C
	Only the O<sub>2</sub><sup>2-</sup>	has all electrons paired. Beware of assuming the lewis structure predicts whether electrons are paired, molecular orbital theory is used for that.

15. The bond order in NO<sup>+</sup> is
		(a) 1	
		(b) 1.5	
		(c) 2	
		(d) 3

Answer: D
	There are 8 electrons in bonding orbitals and 2 electrons in anti-bonding orbitals.

		(a) O<sub>2</sub>	
		(b) O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>
		(c) O<sub>2</sub><sup>2-</sup>	
		(d) O<sub>2</sub><sup>2+</sup>

Answer: D
	The species with the fewest anti-bonding orbitals and the most bonding oribitals should have the strongest bond, which shortens the bond length.
	
17. Which metal is most likely to occur in nature as oxides, sulfides, carbonates, and silicates?
		(a) Hg	
		(b) Lu	
		(c) Hf	
		(d) Zn

Answer: D
	- Electron configurations:
		- Mercury: [Xe]6s²4f¹⁴5d¹⁰
		- Lutetium: [Xe]6s²4f¹⁴5d¹
		- Hafnium: [Xe]6s²4f¹⁴5d²
		- Zinc: [Ar]4s²3d¹⁰
	- All 4 elements have 2 valence electrons.
	- Zinc is the smallest of these elements, which means Zn-O bonds can be shorter and stronger than in the other Metal oxides that could form. So ZnO is more likely to form in nature than the others.
