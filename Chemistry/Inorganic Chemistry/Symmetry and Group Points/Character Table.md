### Definition

- A <u>character table</u> is a chart that displays the behavior of different molecular functions under symmetry operations.
  
- It's a way to group and organize molecular functions based on their symmetry properties.
  
- It describes the irreducible representations of a molecule's symmetry group.

### Example - C<sub>2v</sub> Point Group

| C<sub>2v</sub> | E | C<sub>2</sub> (z) | σv(xz) | σv(yz) | linear, rotations | quadratic  |
|:---:|:-:|:------:|:------:|:------:|-------------------|------------|
|  A<sub>1</sub> | 1 |    1   |    1   |    1   | z                 | x<sup>2</sup>, y<sup>2</sup>, z<sup>2</sup> |
|  A<sub>2</sub> | 1 |    1   |   -1   |   -1   | R<sub>z</sub>                | xy         |
|  B<sub>1</sub> | 1 |   -1   |    1   |   -1   | x, R<sub>y</sub>             | xz         |
|  B<sub>2</sub> | 1 |   -1   |   -1   |    1   | y, R<sub>x</sub>             | yz         |

1 = unaffected or unchanged orbital
-1 = changed or reversed orbital

### Example - C<sub>2h</sub> Point Group

| C<sub>2h</sub> | E | C<sub>2</sub> (z) |  i | σ<sub>h</sub> | linear, rotations | quadratic      |
|:--------------:|:-:|:------:|:--:|:--:|-------------------|----------------|
| A<sub>g</sub>             | 1 | 1      | 1  | 1  | R<sub>z</sub>                | x<sup>2</sup>, y<sup>2</sup>, z<sup>2</sup>, xy |
| B<sub>g</sub>             | 1 | -1     | 1  | -1 | R<sub>x</sub>, R<sub>y</sub>            | xz, yz         |
| A<sub>u</sub>             | 1 | 1      | -1 | -1 | z                 |                |
| B<sub>u</sub>             | 1 | -1     | -1 | 1  | x, y              |                |



### Summary

A character table is a mathematical tool used in group theory to organize the symmetry properties of molecules and crystals. It is a table that lists the symmetry elements, symmetry operations, and irreducible representations of a point group. The character table provides a systematic and concise way of describing the symmetry properties of a molecule or crystal, and it is essential for understanding the electronic and geometric properties of these systems.

The rows of a character table correspond to the irreducible representations of the point group, while the columns correspond to the symmetry operations of the point group. Each entry in the table is a character, which is a mathematical function that assigns a numerical value to each symmetry operation in the point group. The character reflects the way in which the symmetry operation affects a particular set of functions, such as the atomic orbitals in a molecule or the lattice points in a crystal.

The character table provides a wealth of information about the symmetry properties of a molecule or crystal, including:

- The number of irreducible representations in the point group
- The symmetry species of the irreducible representations
- The symmetry operations that belong to each symmetry species
- The characters of each symmetry operation in each irreducible representation
- The multiplication table for the irreducible representations


### Caveman Campfire

Imagine you in cave, making different shapes out of clay. Some clay shapes can fit together, some cannot. Character tables help you know if clay shapes fit together, or if clay shapes do not fit together.

You get big pile of clay shapes and some join together to make a bigger shape, like a pot or a different shape pot. Character tables help you organize your clay shapes by friendship, and friendship is good, so character tables are good.

By knowing this, you can make the best use of your clay shapes and create different shaped pots.
