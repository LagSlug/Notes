<h1>Abelian Group</h1>

- An <u>Abelian group</u> refers to a mathematical group of symmetry operations that commute.
  
- Commute means that the order in which the operations are performed does not affect the final result.

- Abelian groups are named after the Norwegian mathematician <u>Niels Henrik Abel</u>, who was a pioneer in the study of algebraic structures known as groups.
