# Degenerate

In the context of inorganic chemistry and point groups, "degenerate" refers to two or more energy levels or molecular orbitals that have the same energy. This means that they are indistinguishable and cannot be differentiated based on their energy.

Degeneracy is an important concept in inorganic chemistry, particularly in the context of molecular orbitals and symmetry. In molecules, the symmetry of the molecular orbitals is determined by the symmetry of the molecule's point group. When two or more orbitals have the same energy and symmetry, they are said to be degenerate.

For example, in octahedral complexes, the d-orbitals of the metal ion can be split into two sets of three orbitals each, with one set higher in energy than the other. Within each set of three, the orbitals have the same energy and are degenerate. This splitting of the d-orbitals is known as crystal field splitting, and the resulting energy level diagram is known as a crystal field diagram.

Degeneracy has important implications for the properties and reactivity of molecules. For example, degenerate orbitals can participate in bonding and can be populated by electrons to form bonding or non-bonding molecular orbitals. The degeneracy of orbitals also affects the spectroscopic properties of molecules, such as the colors of transition metal complexes in solution.
