- [[Persons of Interest/Mineralogy/Johann Friedrich Christian Hessel|Johann F. C. Hessel]] proved that there are only 32 kinds of crystal symmetry (point groups) in Euclidean space.
- The 32 point groups can be further classified into seven crystal systems.
- The seven crystal systems are: 
	1. monoclinic
	2. triclinic
	3. trigonal
	4. cubic
	5. tetragonal
	6. hexagonal
	7. orthorhombic
- Point groups are classified based on the symmetry of an object, molecule, or crystal.
- The symmetry of a molecule affects its physical and chemical properties, such as its polarity and reactivity.
  
- Symmetry exists in nature, art, and architecture.

### Roadmap to Molecular Orbitals

#### 0. Atomic Orbitals


#### 1. Molecular Geometry

- To understand molecular orbitals and why molecules will form bonds, start by identifying the shape of a molecule using VSEPR theory.

- In VSEPR theory, a molecule can be arranged into one of many shapes based on the configuration that bonded and unbonded electrons form around an atom.

#### 2. VSEPR Theory

-  The <u>Valence-Shell Electron-Pair Repulsion</u> model (pronounced "vesper") can be used to predict the shapes of molecules.



-  Electrons are found in <u>electron orbitals</u> when bound to an atom.
-  Orbitals have <u>electron affinity</u>, and attract electrons.

-  Orbitals are found in <u>orbital shells</u>, which come in four flavors: s, p, d, and f.

![[Chemistry/VSEPR Theory/Orbital Shells]]

- Electrons enter orbitals according to a set of rules, where the lowest energy oribitals are consumed first.

![[Chemistry/VSEPR Theory/Orbital Precedence]]

-  Non-bonded electrons have more energy than bonded electrons, and will experience an "axial/equatorial effect".
-  The <u>axial/equatorial effect</u> occurs when non-bonded electrons move to equitorial positions to obtain the most space.

#### 3. Symmetry Analysis

- A <u>symmetry operation</u> is a way of changing the orientation of a molecule so that it looks exactly the same as before.

| ------------- | ------------------ | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| E             | Identity           | "Whole of space"                 | No observable change                                   |
| C<sub>n</sub> | Rotation by 360°/n | n-fold symmetry axis             | Rotates by 360°/n                                      |
| σ             | Reflection         | mirror plane                     | Reflects across a plane                                |
| *i*           | Inversion          | center of inversion              |                                                        |
| S<sub>n</sub> | Improper Rotation  | n-fold axis of improper rotation | Rotates by 360°/n followed by perpendicular reflection |
 
- A <u>symmetry element</u> is a geometric feature, such as a point, line, or plane, around which a symmetry operation is performed.
- A <u>point group</u> defines a set of symmetry operations that leave the molecule in the same spacial orientation.
