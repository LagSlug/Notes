# Extended Solids (Crystalline Solids)

- Materials with highly ordered and repeating structure on a macroscopic scale.
- Arrangement of atoms or molecules is highly regular and predictable.
- Examples include metals (iron, copper) and non-metals (diamond, quartz, salt).
- Unique physical properties such as high melting/boiling points, hardness and electrical conductivity arise from ordered structure.
