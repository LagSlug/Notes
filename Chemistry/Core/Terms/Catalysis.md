# Catalysis

- <u>Catalysis</u> is the process by which a substance, known as a catalyst, increases the rate of a chemical reaction without being consumed in the reaction.

- <u>Catalysts</u> work by lowering the activation energy required for the reaction to occur, thereby increasing the reaction rate.

- Catalysis is widely used in industrial processes, such as the production of fuels, chemicals, and pharmaceuticals, to improve the efficiency and selectivity of chemical reactions.

- Catalysts can be classified into two main types: <u>homogeneous catalysts</u>, which are in the same phase as the reactants, and <u>heterogeneous catalysts</u>, which are in a different phase.

- Heterogeneous catalysts are widely used in industry due to their stability and ease of separation from the reaction mixture.

- The activity of a catalyst can be influenced by its chemical composition, structure, and surface properties, which can be modified through various techniques such as doping and surface functionalization.

- Catalysis plays a critical role in many biological processes, such as enzyme-catalyzed reactions, and is an essential component of many environmental and energy-related applications.
