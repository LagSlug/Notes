# Van der Waals force

- The <u>van der Waals force</u> is a distance-dependent interaction between atoms or molecules, which quickly vanishes at longer distances.
  
- Unlike ionic or covalent bonds, the van der Waals force does not result from a chemical electronic bond and is weak and susceptible to disturbance.
  
- It underlies many properties of organic compounds and molecular solids, including their solubility in polar and non-polar media.
  
- The distance between atoms at which the force becomes repulsive rather than attractive as the atoms approach one another is called the <u>van der Waals contact distance</u>, resulting from the mutual repulsion between the atoms' electron clouds.
  
- The van der Waals forces are a combination of the London dispersion forces, Debye forces, and the Keesom force.
