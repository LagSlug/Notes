# Lattice point

- A <u>lattice point</u> is a point in space that represents the position of a particle in a crystal lattice.

- A lattice point is the intersection of three or more lattice lines in a crystal lattice.

- The number of lattice points in a crystal lattice depends on the symmetry of the lattice and the unit cell dimensions.

- The lattice points determine the geometry of the crystal lattice and the interatomic distances between the constituent particles.

- The lattice points can be used to calculate the lattice parameters and the volume of the unit cell.

- The lattice points are important for understanding the physical and chemical properties of crystalline solids
