# Semiconductors

### Introduction

- Semiconductors formed from equal amounts of Group 13/15 or Group 12/16 elements are isoelectronic with silicon and can have enhanced properties based on changes in the electronic structure and electron motion.
  
- Gallium arsenide (GaAs) is a Group 13/15 semiconductor, along with GaP, InP, AlAs, and GaN. Ternary and quaternary Group 13/15 compounds, such as Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>1−x</sub>As, <span style="white-space: nowrap;">InAs<sub>1−y</sub>P<sub>y</sub></span>, and In<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>1−x</sub>As<sub>1−y</sub>P<sub>y</sub>, can also be formed with valuable semiconducting properties.
  
- GaAs-based semiconductor devices respond more rapidly to electrical signals than those based on silicon, making them better for amplifying high-frequency signals, such as satellite TV signals.
  
- Some Group 13/15 semiconductors, such as GaN, have a metastable cubic structure and a stable hexagonal structure. They allow for the fabrication of luminescent devices that produce high-intensity blue light and high-power transistors.
  
- The Group 12/16 semiconductors, which comprise compounds containing Zn, Cd, and Hg as cations and O, S, Se, and Te as anions, can crystallize in either the cubic sphalerite phase or the hexagonal wurtzite phase. The form synthesized has characteristic semiconducting properties.
  
- Some other semiconducting oxides and sulfides, such as tin sulfide (SnS<sub>2</sub>), have promising characteristics for photovoltaic devices and contain cheap, readily available, and nontoxic elements.
