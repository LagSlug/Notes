# Doping

- Doping is the intentional introduction of impurities or foreign atoms into a material to modify its electrical and optical properties.

- The process is widely used in the semiconductor industry to create p-type and n-type semiconductors, which are essential components in electronic devices.

- In p-type doping, an impurity with fewer valence electrons than the host material, such as boron, is introduced, creating holes in the valence band and increasing the electrical conductivity.

- In n-type doping, an impurity with more valence electrons than the host material, such as phosphorus, is introduced, creating additional electrons in the conduction band and increasing the electrical conductivity.

- Doping can be accomplished through various techniques, such as ion implantation or diffusion.

- The concentration and distribution of the dopants can be controlled to achieve specific electrical and optical properties.

- Doping is also used in other fields, such as photovoltaics and lighting, to modify the properties of materials for better performance.
