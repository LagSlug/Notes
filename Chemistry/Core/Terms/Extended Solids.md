### Extended Solids

- <u>Extended solids</u> are materials that have an extended three-dimensional structure.

- They can be classified into two major types: crystalline solids and amorphous solids.

- Crystalline solids have a regular, ordered structure, while amorphous solids lack long-range order and have a more disordered atomic arrangement.

### Examples of extended solids include:

- Metals, such as copper and iron.
- Semiconductors, such as silicon.
- Ceramics, such as aluminum oxide and silicon carbide.
