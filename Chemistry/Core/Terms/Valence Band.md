# Valence Band

- The <u>valence band</u> is the range of energy levels in a material that is occupied by valence electrons, which are the outermost electrons of an atom that participate in chemical bonding.

- In solids, the valence band is the highest energy level that is completely filled with electrons at 0 Kelvin (absolute zero).

- The valence band is separated from the conduction band by the <u>band gap</u>, which represents the minimum energy required to promote an electron from the valence band to the conduction band.

- The properties of the valence band determine the electronic and optical properties of a material, such as its electrical conductivity, optical absorption, and chemical reactivity.

- In semiconductors the valence band is partially, and in insulators the valence band is completely filled, which results in a finite band gap and limits their electrical conductivity.

- The valence band can be raised or lowered through doping or other chemical modifications to the material.

- The properties of the valence band are critical for the functioning of electronic devices such as transistors and integrated circuits.
