# Conduction Band

- The <u>conduction band</u> is a range of energy levels in a material that are not occupied by electrons at 0 Kelvin (absolute zero) but can be excited to higher energy levels to allow the flow of electric current.
  
- In solids, the conduction band is the highest energy level that can be occupied by electrons in a material under normal conditions.
  
- Electrons in the conduction band are free to move throughout the material and can carry an electric current.
  
- The energy difference between the valence band and the conduction band is called the [band gap](Chemistry/Core/Terms/Band%20Gap.md).
  
- The width of the conduction band determines the electrical conductivity of a material, with wider bands corresponding to materials that conduct electricity more readily.
  
- The conduction band can be raised or lowered through doping or other chemical modifications to the material.
  
- The properties of the conduction band are critical for the functioning of electronic devices such as transistors and integrated circuits.
