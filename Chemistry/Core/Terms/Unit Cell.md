# Unit Cell

- A <u>unit cell</u> is the smallest repeating unit of a crystal lattice in a solid material.

- It is defined by its lattice parameters, which describe the size and shape of the unit cell.
  
- The lattice parameters are typically expressed as the lengths of the edges of the unit cell (a, b, c) and the angles between them (α, β, γ).

- The unit cell can be visualized as a three-dimensional box with atoms or ions located at specific points within the box.

- The arrangement of atoms or ions within the unit cell determines the crystal structure of the material.

- Different materials can have different crystal structures based on the arrangement of their unit cells.

- Some common types of unit cells include simple cubic, body-centered cubic, and face-centered cubic, among others.

- The unit cell is a useful concept in materials science and inorganic chemistry because it allows researchers to understand and predict the properties of crystalline materials.

### Primative Unit Cell

- A <u>primitive unit cell</u> is the smallest repeating unit that can be used to build a primitive lattice.

- In a primitive unit cell, the lattice points are located only at the corners of the unit cell.

### Non-Primative Unit Cell

- A <u>non-primitive unit cell</u> is a larger repeating unit that contains more than one lattice point.

- In a non-primitive unit cell, the lattice points can be located at the corners, faces, or in the center of the unit cell.
