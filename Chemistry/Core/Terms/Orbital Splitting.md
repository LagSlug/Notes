- <u>Orbital splitting</u> occurs when degenerate d-orbitals split into two different energy levels.
- The energy difference $(Δ)$ between the two sets of d-orbitals is called the crystal field splitting parameter.

- In an octahedral field, the d-orbitals are split into:
	1. $t_{2g}$​ levels (lower energy)
	2. $e_g$​ levels (higher energy)
	3. with the energy difference given as $Δ_o$​

- In a tetrahedral field, the d-orbitals are split into:
	1. $e$ levels (lower energy)
	2. $t_2$​ levels (higher energy)
	3. with the energy difference given as $Δ_t$
