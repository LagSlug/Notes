# Surface Functionalization

- <u>Surface functionalization</u> is the process of modifying the surface properties of a material to achieve specific functional or chemical properties.

- It involves attaching functional groups or molecules to the surface of the material through chemical or physical methods.

- Surface functionalization can be used to enhance the material's properties, such as wettability, adhesion, and biocompatibility, and to introduce new functionalities, such as catalytic activity and sensing capabilities.

- Various techniques can be used for surface functionalization, including plasma treatment, chemical vapor deposition, and electrochemical methods.

- The choice of functional groups or molecules to attach depends on the desired application of the material.

- Surface functionalization has a wide range of applications, including biomedical engineering, energy storage, catalysis, and sensing.
