- Effective nuclear charge ($Z_{\text{eff}}$) is the net positive charge experienced by an electron in an atom.
- It is influenced by the actual nuclear charge $(Z)$ and the shielding effect $(S)$ of other electrons.

$$
	Z_{\text{eff}} = Z - S
$$

- Across a period (horizontal trend), $Z_{\text{eff}}$ generally increases from left to right, resulting in a reduced atomic radius.
- Down a group (vertical trend), $Z_{\text{eff}}$ remains relatively constant due to increased shielding, leading to an increased atomic radius.
- $Z_{\text{eff}}$ provides a simplified understanding of electron behavior in atoms and explains trends in atomic properties.
