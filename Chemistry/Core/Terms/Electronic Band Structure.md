# Electronic Band Structure

- Bands refer to the distribution of allowed energy states for electrons in a crystalline solid.
- Bands are separated by regions called <u>band gaps</u>, where no energy states are allowed.
- Number and arrangement of bands depend on atomic and molecular arrangement.
- Highest occupied band is called the valence band, while the lowest unoccupied band is called the conduction band.
- Energy difference between these two bands is known as the band gap, and it determines the material's electrical conductivity.
- Plays a crucial role in determining electronic, optical, and magnetic properties.
- Understanding band structure essential for designing and developing new materials with tailored electronic properties for various technological applications.
