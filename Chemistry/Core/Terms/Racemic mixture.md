# Racemic mixture

### Definition

- A <u>racemic mixture</u> is a combination of two enantiomers of a chiral molecule in equal proportions.

### Etymology

- The term "racemic mixture" is derived from the Latin word "racemus" meaning "a bunch of grapes".

### Keywords

- Enantiomers
- Mirror-image isomers
- Non-superimposable
- Plane-polarized light

### Nomenclature

- The prefix "rac-" is used to denote a racemic mixture.
- Denoted by prefix (±)- or dl-
- Also by prefix rac- (or racem-), RS, SR (all italic)
- If ratio is not 1:1 or unknown, use (+)/(−), d/l- or d/l- (with slash)
- Usage of d and l discouraged by IUPAC
### Properties

- The properties of a racemic mixture are determined by the enantiomers within it.
  
#### Physical Characteristics

- Physical characteristics of a racemic mixture can be similar to those of a single enantiomer, but may have some differences.
  
- A racemate may have different physical properties, such as melting points, solubilities, and boiling points, than either of the pure enantiomers.

#### Optical Activity

- Optical and chemical properties of a racemic mixture are typically distinct from those of the individual enantiomers.
  
- A racemate is a mixture is optically inactive, meaning it does not rotate plane-polarized light.

- The two enantiomers present in a racemate rotate plane-polarized light in opposite directions, but their rotations cancel out as they are present in equal amounts.

#### Biologic Activity

- Pharmaceuticals may be available as a racemate or as the pure enantiomer, which can have different potencies and biological effects.

- Pure enantiomers frequently have different biological effects due to the chiral asymmetries in biological systems.
