# Ceramics

- Ceramics are non-metallic, inorganic materials that are typically made by heating natural or synthetic minerals or clays at high temperatures.

- They are characterized by their hardness, brittleness, and resistance to high temperatures, wear, and corrosion.

- Ceramics can be classified into two broad categories: traditional ceramics and advanced ceramics.

- Traditional ceramics, such as pottery, bricks, and tiles, are made from naturally occurring materials and are generally used for utilitarian purposes.

- Advanced ceramics, such as alumina, silicon carbide, and zirconia, are engineered materials that are designed for specific applications in industries such as aerospace, electronics, and biomedical engineering.

- The properties of ceramics are highly dependent on their composition, microstructure, and processing conditions.

- Ceramics can exhibit a wide range of properties, including high strength, hardness, and stiffness, as well as electrical and thermal insulation.
