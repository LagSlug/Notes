# Lattice

- A <u>lattice</u> is a regular, repeating arrangement of atoms, ions, or molecules in a crystalline solid.

- The lattice structure of a solid determines its physical properties, such as melting point, hardness, and conductivity.

- The lattice structure is determined by the arrangement of the constituent particles and their intermolecular forces.

- The lattice structure is described by the crystal system and the crystal lattice parameters, such as lattice constant and lattice angles.

- A lattice can have different symmetries, such as cubic, tetragonal, orthorhombic, monoclinic, triclinic, and rhombohedral, depending on the crystal system.

- The lattice structure can be visualized using X-ray crystallography, which provides information about the positions of the constituent particles in the lattice.


### Primitive

- A <u>primitive lattice</u> is a lattice that contains only one lattice point per unit cell.

- A primitive lattice is the simplest and most symmetric lattice that can be used to describe a crystal structure.

- Primitive lattices are common in simple elemental structures, such as the face-centered cubic (FCC) and body-centered cubic (BCC) lattices.

### Non-primitive

- A <u>non-primitive lattice</u> is a lattice that contains more than one lattice point per unit cell.

- A non-primitive lattice can be obtained by adding more lattice points to the primitive lattice or by using a non-primitive unit cell.


- Non-primitive lattices are common in complex structures, such as those of many minerals and organic compounds.

- Non-primitive lattices are often used to describe the symmetry of crystals that have more than one type of atom or ion in their unit cell.

### Centered Cells

- <u>Centered cells</u> are unit cells in crystal structures that contain additional lattice points at positions other than the corners.
  
- In a centered cell, the additional lattice points can be located at the center of each face, at the center of the unit cell, or at both positions simultaneously.
- Centered cells are classified according to the position of the additional lattice points, such as face-centered cubic (FCC), body-centered cubic (BCC), and primitive-centered cubic (PCC) cells.
  
- In a <u>face-centered cubic</u> (FCC) cell, there is one additional lattice point at the center of each face in addition to the lattice points at the corners.
  
- In a <u>body-centered cubic</u> (BCC) cell, there is one additional lattice point at the center of the unit cell in addition to the lattice points at the corners.
  
- In a <u>primitive-centered cubic</u> (PCC) cell, there is one additional lattice point at the center of the unit cell and one at the center of each face.
  
- Centered cells are used to describe the crystal structures of many metals, alloys, and other materials that have a high degree of symmetry.
  
- Centered cells have unique geometric properties that make them useful for understanding the physical and chemical properties of materials, such as their density, melting point, and electrical conductivity.

### Motif

- A recurring structural unit or pattern in a molecule or crystal structure.

- Can have unique properties or reactivities.

- Common motifs in inorganic chemistry include coordination complexes.

- Coordination complexes often follow specific patterns, such as tetrahedral, square planar, or octahedral.

### Basis

- A set of atoms or molecules used as building blocks for constructing more complex structures.

- Used in the context of crystallography to describe the crystal lattice of a solid.

- Basis atoms or molecules are arranged in a repeating unit cell.

- The choice of basis can affect properties such as symmetry and packing efficiency.
