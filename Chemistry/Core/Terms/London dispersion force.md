# London dispersion force

- <u>London dispersion force</u> (LDF) is a weak attraction between atoms or molecules caused by temporary fluctuations in electron distribution, which can create a temporary dipole.

- It is the weakest intermolecular force.
  
- It is a type of van der Waals force and typically acts between nonpolar molecules.

- They are also known as dispersion forces, London forces, instantaneous dipoleâ€“induced dipole forces, fluctuating induced dipole bonds, or loosely as van der Waals forces.

- The name "London dispersion forces" comes from Fritz London, a German physicist.

1. Two molecules drift near to one another.
2. The electron distribution fluctuates in one molecule.
3. A dipole is induced in the other molecule.
