# Band Structure

- <u>Band structure</u> refers to the distribution of energy levels or bands in a solid material, which determine the electronic and optical properties of the material.

- The band structure arises from the electronic structure of the material, which is characterized by the interactions between electrons and the atomic lattice of the material.

- In solids, the energy levels of electrons are grouped into bands, separated by energy gaps, known as band gaps.

- The band structure can be determined experimentally using various spectroscopic techniques, such as X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy.

- The band structure plays a crucial role in various technological applications, such as semiconductor devices, solar cells, and superconductors.
