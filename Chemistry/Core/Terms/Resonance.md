# Resonance

- Resonance, also known as mesomerism, is a way of describing bonding in certain molecules or polyatomic ions by combining several contributing structures into a resonance hybrid.

- Resonance is particularly useful for analyzing delocalized electrons where the bonding can't be expressed by one single Lewis structure.

- Resonance structures, also known as canonical structures, are combined to form a hybrid structure in valence bond theory.
