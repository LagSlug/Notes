- <u>Crystal Field Theory</u> is a model used to explain the electronic structures, colors, and magnetic properties of coordination complexes.
- Ligands are considered as point charges or dipoles that interact with the metal ion's d-orbitals.
- The interaction between the ligands and the metal ion leads to the <u>splitting</u> of the degenerate d-orbitals.
