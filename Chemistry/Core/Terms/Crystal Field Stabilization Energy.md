- Crystal Field Stabilization Energy (CFSE) is the energy gained by a metal ion due to the occupation of electrons in split d-orbitals.

<u>Formula</u>
$$
CFSE=−0.4Δn(t_{2g})+0.6Δn(e_g)
$$
- $n(t_{2g})$ and $n(e_g)$ are the number of electrons in the $t_{2g}$​ and $e_g$ orbitals.

### High Spin vs Low Spin
- When electrons pair within an orbital, their repelling charges require a <u>pairing energy</u> overcome.
- When pairing energy (PE) is greater than orbital splitting energy ($Δ_o$), the electron will be promoted to the higher energy orbial.
$$
\begin{aligned}
Δ_o &> PE  \rightarrow \text{Electrons paired} 
&&\rightarrow 
\text{Low Spin}\\
Δ_o &< PE \rightarrow \text{Electrons promoted} 
&&\rightarrow
\text{High Spin}
\end{aligned}
  $$
- When electrons have enough energy to be promoted to the $e_g$ orbital, they no longer pair with
