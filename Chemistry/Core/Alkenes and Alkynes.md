# Alkenes and Alkynes

*About, about, in reel and rout
The death-fires danced at night;
The water, like a witch's oils,
Burnt green, and blue and white.*

The Rime of the Ancient Mariner
By Samuel Taylor Coleridge

### Key Terms

- [[Chemistry/Core/Terms/Electrophile|Electrophiles]] - species that attract electrons.
- Nucleophiles - species that attract protons.
- Resonance - the delocalization of charge influences cation stability.
- Resonance forms - ways of describing the resonance states.
- Hydration - 
- Hydroboration - 
- Oxidation-Reduction - 
- Hydride shifts - a reaction mechanism in organic chemistry where a hydrogen with two electrons shifts to an adjacent carbon atom, often resulting in the formation of a more stable carbocation intermediate.

### Timeline

#### Notable Scientists

-   1779: Carl Wilhelm Scheele, a Swedish chemist, prepares acetylene by treating calcium carbide with water.
-   1795: Louis Claude Cadet de Gassicourt, a French chemist, discovers olefiant gas (ethylene) during experiments with oil of vitriol (sulfuric acid) and alcohol.
-   1815: Michel Eugène Chevreul, a French chemist, isolates a mixture of hydrocarbons from animal fats, which he calls "olefiant gas." This mixture was later found to contain ethylene, the simplest alkene.
-   1830s: Henry Victor Regnault, a French chemist, studies the physical properties of alkenes and alkynes and shows that they are distinct from those of saturated hydrocarbons.
-   1861: August Wilhelm von Hofmann, a German chemist, discovers acetylene, the simplest alkyne, while working with the compound vinyl bromide.
-   1864: Friedrich August Kekulé, a German chemist, proposes the concept of the carbon-carbon double bond, which is the defining feature of alkenes. He also suggests the existence of the carbon-carbon triple bond, which characterizes alkynes.
-   1877: Adolf von Baeyer, a German chemist, synthesizes the first cyclic compound with a carbon-carbon double bond, which he calls cyclohexene.
-  1900: Marcellin Berthelot, a French chemist, discovers that alkenes can be prepared by heating alcohols in the presence of strong acids, a reaction known as dehydration. This method is still used today to produce alkenes from alcohols.
-   1901: Victor Grignard, a French chemist, discovers the Grignard reagent, which is a powerful tool for synthesizing alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, and other organic compounds that contain carbon-carbon double or triple bonds.
-   1902: Victor Meyer, a German chemist, discovers the "Meyer reaction," a method for preparing alkenes by heating a mixture of an alcohol and an acid chloride in the presence of a catalyst, such as zinc chloride.
-   1913: Walter Reppe, a German chemist, discovers the "Reppe reaction," which is a method for preparing alkenes by treating acetylene with various reagents, such as hydrogen, water, or carbon monoxide. This reaction is still used today to produce a variety of alkenes and other unsaturated compounds.
-   1914: Robert Robinson, a British chemist, discovers the "Robinson annulation," a method for synthesizing cyclic compounds with a carbon-carbon double bond, such as indoles and quinolines.
-   1919: Roger Adams, an American chemist, discovers the "Adams catalyst," which is a type of platinum catalyst that can be used to hydrogenate alkenes and other unsaturated compounds. The Adams catalyst has been widely used in the production of pharmaceuticals, fragrances, and other chemicals.
-   1924: Herman Pines, an American chemist, discovers the "Pines chlorination," a method for chlorinating alkenes using sulfuryl chloride and a catalyst, such as aluminum chloride or iron chloride. This reaction is still used today to produce a range of chlorinated organic compounds.
-   1929: Paul Sabatier and Senderens, French chemists, discover that alkenes can be hydrogenated in the presence of a nickel catalyst, leading to the production of a range of useful products, including margarine.
-   1929: French chemist Yves Chauvin discovers olefin metathesis, proposing a new mechanism that allows for the exchange of alkylidene moieties between two olefins, leading to the formation of new alkenes with a new carbon-carbon double bond location.
-   1931: Linus Pauling, an American chemist, proposes a theory to explain the bonding in molecules with carbon-carbon double bonds, known as the "resonance theory." This theory helps to explain the reactivity of alkenes and other unsaturated compounds.
-   1933: Ernst Otto Fischer, a German chemist, discovers metal carbonyls, which are compounds containing a metal atom and a carbonyl ligand. Metal carbonyls are important intermediates in the synthesis of alkenes and other organic compounds.
-   1950: Karl Ziegler, a German chemist, discovers a new type of catalyst for the polymerization of alkenes, which becomes known as the Ziegler catalyst. This catalyst is based on a combination of a transition metal and an organoaluminum compound, and it has revolutionized the production of polyethylene and other plastics.
-   1951: Melvin Calvin, an American chemist, discovers the "Calvin cycle," which is the series of reactions by which plants and other organisms convert carbon dioxide into organic compounds, including alkenes and other unsaturated hydrocarbons.
-   1963: Karl Ziegler and Giulio Natta, German and Italian chemists, respectively, are awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for their discovery of the Ziegler-Natta catalyst and its application to the polymerization of alkenes.
-   1985: Richard R. Schrock and Robert H. Grubbs, American chemists, independently develop new types of catalysts for the synthesis of alkenes, known as "olefin metathesis catalysts." These catalysts have become widely used in organic synthesis and polymer chemistry.



### Required Concepts

- Hydration and hydroboration/oxidation allow for the addition of water across an unsymmetrical double bond in either a Markovnikov or an anti-Markovnikov fashion.
- Less-stable carbocations can rearrange to more-stable ones through hydride shifts.

# Electrophilic Addition

- Electrophilic addition is a two-step process that occurs via a carbocation intermediate.
- Addition reactions, especially HX additions, involve the formation of a carbocation that is captured by X<sup>-</sup>.

### Electrophilic Addition in Alkenes

- The reaction of 2-butene with hydrocholoric acid produces a [[Chemistry/Core/Terms/Racemic mixture|Racemic mixture]] of 2-chlorobutane.

- Hydrogen is an electrophile, and attracts the electrons from the π bond in 2-butene.
- Chloride ion are nucleophiles, and is attracted to the elecrophilic center of the intermediate butane cation.
