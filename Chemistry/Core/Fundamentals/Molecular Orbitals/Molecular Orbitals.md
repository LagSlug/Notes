- The s orbitals for the 3 hydrogens are used to set up the sigma and anti bonding combinations of N sp 3 orbitals and the H 1s orbitals. Polyatomic Molecular Orbital Theory Transformational properties of atomic orbitals Atomic orbital Transforms as s x2+y 2+z 2 px x py y pz z dz2 z2, 2z 2-x2-y2 dx2-y2 x2-y2 dxy xy dxz xz dyz yz S py â€¢ When bonds are formed, atomic orbitals combine according to their symmetry.

- Symmetry properties and degeneracy of orbitals and bonds can be. In NH3, the HOMO (Highly Occupied Molecular Orbital) is a mostly nitrogen based orbital that corresponds to the Lone pair of electrons.
  
- Why does the last p orbital of N in NH3 hybridize?
	-   Orbitals are not hybridized if they are needed for pi bonding.
	-   Otherwise, orbitals are hybridized to participate in either sigma bonding with other atoms or to accommodate lone pairs.
