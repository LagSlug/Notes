# Bond Order

### Definition

Bond order measures the number of bonds between two atoms and indicates bond strength and stability, with higher orders representing stronger bonds.

- Bond order is determined by subtracting the number of anti-bonding electrons from the number of bonding electrons and dividing by two.
  
- Bond order is typically expressed as a whole number, with 1 for a single bond, 2 for a double bond, and 3 for a triple bond.

### General Formula

Bond Order = (Number of Bonding Electrons - Number of Anti-bonding Electrons) / 2

### Shortcut

Bond orders for some diatomic molecules:
| Li<sub>2</sub> | Be<sub>2</sub> | B<sub>2</sub> | C<sub>2</sub> | N<sub>2</sub> | O<sub>2</sub> | F<sub>2</sub> |
|:--------------:|:--------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|
|        1       |        0       |       1       |       2       |       3       |       2       |       1       |

1. Sum the bond order between two species
2. Add the charge value to this number (negative charges reduce the sum)
3. Divide the sum by 2 to get the bond order.

| NO<sup>2-</sup> | $[(3 + 2) - 2] / 2 = 1.5$ |     1.5    |   |
