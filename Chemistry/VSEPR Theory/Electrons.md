- The <u>electron</u> ( e<sup>−</sup> or β<sup>−</sup>) is a subatomic particle with a negative electric charge.
- The electron's mass is approximately 1/1836 that of the proton.
- The antiparticle of an electron is a positron, which has positive electric charge.

###### Repulsion

- Electrons repel other negatively charged particles, such as other non-bonded or bonded electrons.
- In a molecule, the repulsion between electrons can affect the molecule's shape and stability.
- This is the basis for [[Chemistry/VSEPR Theory/VSEPR Theory | Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion theory]].

###### Attractive Forces
  
- <u>Electronegativity</u> is a measure of an atom's attraction for electrons.
- <u>Electropositivity</u> is the opposite of electronegativity, and characterizes an atom's tendency to donate valence electrons.

![[Chemistry/VSEPR Theory/Periodic Table - Electronegativity]]

-  Electronegativity increases from left to right across a period
-  Electronegativity decreases from top to bottom down a group

-  Electrons move toward electronegativity, and away from electropositivity.

###### Quantum State

- <u>Wave-particle duality</u> is the concept that every particle can be described as both a particle and a wave.

```
We have two contradictory pictures of reality; separately neither of them fully explains the phenomena of light, but together they do.  

- Albert Einstein
```

-  The <u>spin</u> of an electron refers to its angular momentum and magnetic moment, which are associated with the rotation of an electron around its own axis.
-  The direction of electron spin is often represented by a quantum number, either +1/2 or -1//2.
