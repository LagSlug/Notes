# Definition

- A <u>scalar</u> is a value in physics that remains unchanged regardless of coordinate system transformations.
- It represents a quantity with only magnitude and no direction.
- Scalars can be fully described by their numerical value alone.
- Scalars are usually accompanied by units of measurment, for example "10 cm".
