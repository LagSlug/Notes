- A <u>vector</u> is an ordered list of elements, typically represented by scalar values such as numbers.
- Tuples and vectors are both finite ordered lists.

- Vector notation is often used to represent vectors. It uses lowercase letters to signify a vector.
	- Bold, upright: $\mathbf{v}$
	- Bold, italic: $\mathbf{\textit{v}}$
	- Arrow, italic:  $\vec{v}$

# Spatial / Geometric / Euclidean Vector

- Vectors that have a length and orientation can represent the magnitude and direction of a geometric object.
  
Example
- What is the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow when flying west?

$$
\begin{aligned}
	\vec{v} &= \langle 64.7, 0  \rangle \text{ km/h} && \text{African Swallow} \\
	\vec{w} &= \langle 32.4, 0 \rangle \text{ km/h} && \text{European Swallow}
\end{aligned}
$$
- The first component of the vector represents the speed (magnitude) of the bird in the west direction.
- The first component would be negative if the bird flew east.
- The second component is zero because the bird is not moving in the north or south directions.


- Vectors can be visualized as arrows, with length and orientation representing magnitude and direction.


- Vector operations include:
	- addition: ($\vec{v} + \vec{w}$)
	- subtraction: ($\vec{v} - \vec{w}$)
	- scaling: ($c \cdot \vec{v}$)
	  
- Spatial vector components can be represented using coordinate systems like Cartesian, cylindrical, or spherical coordinates.
