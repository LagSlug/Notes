\begin{align}
\textbf{Theorem: } & \text{There are infinitely many prime numbers.} \\
\textbf{Proof: } & \text{Assume for the sake of contradiction that there are only finitely many prime numbers, say } p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n. \\
& \text{Let } P = p_1 p_2 \cdots p_n + 1. \\
& \text{Since } P \text{ is greater than any of the prime numbers } p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n, \\
& \text{it must be either prime or composite.} \\
& \text{If } P \text{ is prime, then we have found a prime number that was not in our original list of primes,} \\
& \text{which contradicts our assumption that there are only finitely many primes.} \\
& \text{On the other hand, if } P \text{ is composite, then it must have a prime factor } p. \\
& \text{Since } p \text{ divides } P, \text{ it cannot be any of the primes } p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n. \\
& \text{But then } p \text{ must be a new prime number not in our original list,} \\
& \text{which again contradicts our assumption.} \\
& \text{Therefore, there must be infinitely many prime numbers.} \\
