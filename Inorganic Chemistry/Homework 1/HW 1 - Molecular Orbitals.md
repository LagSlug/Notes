Molecular Orbital Diagram for Molecular Oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>):
-   Determine the electron configuration of elemental oxygen 
	  [He]2s<sup>2</sup>2p<sup>4</sup>
-   Determine the number of valence electrons in the molecule 
	  Oxygen: 6
-   Write the atomic orbitals (2s and 2p) for each oxygen atom 
-   Form the bonding and antibonding molecular orbitals through linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO)
-   Fill the molecular orbitals with electrons, starting from the lowest energy orbital
-   Determine the number of unpaired electrons and the overall magnetic behavior of the molecule.
-   Note: in the diagram below, the red horizontal lines represent atomic orbitals (AO) and the blue horizontal lines represent molecular orbitals (MO).
-   Molecular orbitals can be either bonding or anti-bonding oribitals.

- The lewis structure of O<sub>2</sub> is misleading in that it would appear to be diamagnetic, but according to molecular orbital theory it is paramagnetic.
