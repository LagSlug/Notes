# Introduction

-   Symmetry is a fundamental concept in chemistry and is defined as an operation or transformation that leaves an object looking the same after it has been carried out.

-   Symmetry is commonly observed in molecules and crystals, and it is an essential tool for understanding their properties and behavior.

-   Symmetry can be used to determine the electronic structure of molecules and predict their spectroscopic properties.

-   Understanding the symmetry of a molecule is important in understanding its properties and behavior.

#### Symmetry Elements

-   <u>Symmetry elements</u> in a molecule are points, lines, or planes that describe operations that leave the molecule unchanged, such as rotation, reflection, inversion, or identity.
-   They are operations that when performed on a molecule, leave it looking the same.

-   Symmetry elements can be identified by examining the symmetry operations of a molecule.

-   Symmetry elements can also be used to determine the <u>point group</u> of a molecule or crystal, which is a group of symmetry operations that leave the object unchanged.


## Symmetry groups

-   Symmetry groups are named using <u>Schoenflies</u> notation or <u>Hermann-Mauguin</u> notation.

-   Symmetry groups describe all possible symmetries of an object, including both rotations and reflections.


## Point Groups

-   A point group is a set of symmetry operations that can be performed on a molecule that leave it looking the same.

-   There are 32 crystallographic point groups and 230 molecular point groups.

-   Point groups are a specific type of symmetry group that only includes rotations and not reflections.

-   Point groups are named after the set of points that remain fixed under the rotations of the group.

-   Point groups are classified by their symmetry elements, which include rotation axes, reflection planes, and inversion centers.

-   Point groups are useful for predicting the properties of molecules, such as their dipole moments and optical activity.

-   The point group is essential in predicting the physical and chemical properties of the object.

-   The symmetry of a molecule can be used to predict its spectroscopic properties, such as IR and Raman spectra, and to understand its reactivity.


## Character Tables

-   A character table is a table that lists the symmetry elements of a point group and their corresponding characters.

-   Characters are values that describe how a particular function changes when a symmetry operation is performed.

-   Character tables are used to determine the symmetry species of molecular vibrations, which is important for understanding infrared and Raman spectra.



#### Spectroscopic Properties

-   The symmetry properties of a molecule can be used to predict its spectroscopic properties, such as the infrared and Raman spectra.

-   Vibrational transitions in a molecule are only allowed if they transform according to the same irreducible representation as the corresponding vibrational mode.

-   Electronic transitions in a molecule are only allowed if they transform according to the same irreducible representation as the corresponding electronic state.

#### Chemical Reactivity

-   The symmetry of a molecule can influence its chemical reactivity.

-   In general, reactions that preserve the symmetry of the molecule are more likely to occur than reactions that break the symmetry.

-   The principles of group theory can be used to predict the stereochemistry of reactions.

#### Applications

-   The principles of group theory are used to predict the spectroscopic properties of molecules, the stereochemistry of reactions, and the electronic structures of molecules.

-   In crystallography, the symmetry of crystals can be used to determine their crystal structure, which is essential in understanding their physical and chemical properties.

| ------ | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| E      | Identity element   | Leaves object unchanged after operation.                                                                                                         |
| C<sub>n</sub>      | Rotation axis      | Rotates object by 360°/n degrees around an axis, appearing identical at n different positions.                                                   |
| σ      | Mirror plane       | Reflects object across a plane, appearing identical on both sides of the plane.                                                                   |
| i      | Inversion center   | Inverts object through a point, appearing identical to its original position.                                                                     |
| S<sub>n</sub>      | Improper rotation  | Combines a rotation axis and a mirror plane. Object is rotated by 360°/n degrees around an axis, and then reflected across a plane perpendicular to the axis. |

#### Identity Symmetry - E

- The identity operator (E) corresponds to the entire molecule and involves no change.  
- Might not be explicitly shown or indicated since all molecules exhibit this symmetry.

For example:
- Rotation by 360° leaves a molecule in the exact same orientation.
  
#### *n*-fold Axis of Rotation - C<sub>n</sub>

- Sometimes called proper rotation.
- Rotates an object about an axis by 2π/n radians or 360°/n.
- Rotation by C<sub>n</sub> leaves the molecule unchanged.

For example:
- The H<sub>2</sub>O molecule has a C<sub>2</sub> axis.
