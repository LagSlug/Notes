We can prove this statement using a proof by cases.

Case 1: $x \geq 6$

In this case, we have $|x-6| = x-6$, so the inequality becomes:

$$(x-6) + x > 3$$

Simplifying this expression gives:

$$2x - 6 > 3$$

Adding 6 to both sides yields:

$$2x > 9$$

Dividing both sides by 2 gives:

$$x > \frac{9}{2}$$

Therefore, the inequality holds for all $x \geq 6$.

Case 2: $x < 6$

In this case, we have $|x-6| = -(x-6)$, so the inequality becomes:

$$-(x-6) + x > 3$$

Simplifying this expression gives:

$$2x - 6 > 3$$

Adding 6 to both sides yields:

$$2x > 9$$

Dividing both sides by 2 gives:

$$x > \frac{9}{2}$$

Therefore, the inequality holds for all $x < 6$ as well.

Since the inequality holds for all possible values of $x$, the proof is complete.
