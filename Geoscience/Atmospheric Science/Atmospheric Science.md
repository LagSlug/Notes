## Troposphere

The troposphere is the lowest layer of the atmosphere, extending from Earth's surface to an altitude of about 11-13 km (7-8 miles) at the equator and about 8 km (5 miles) at the poles [[4](https://scied.ucar.edu/learning-zone/atmosphere/layers-earths-atmosphere)]. It is where most weather phenomena occur, and it contains approximately 80% of the mass of Earth's atmosphere.

### Composition of the Troposphere

-   The troposphere is composed mainly of nitrogen (78.09%) and oxygen (20.95%).
-   Trace amounts of other gases including argon, carbon dioxide, neon, helium, methane, krypton, and hydrogen make up the remaining 0.96% [[3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troposphere)].

### Structure of the Troposphere

-   The troposphere is characterized by a decrease in temperature with altitude.
-   This temperature gradient results from the fact that the troposphere is heated from below by the Earth's surface, which causes warm air to rise and cool air to sink.
-   At the top of the troposphere, there is a boundary called the tropopause, where the temperature stops decreasing and becomes constant [[3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troposphere)].

### Chemistry of the Troposphere

-   The troposphere plays a critical role in the chemistry of the Earth's atmosphere.
-   One important process is the formation of sulfuric acid in the air when sulfur dioxide gas mixes with water droplets. Sulfur dioxide gas is emitted from volcanoes and from coal and oil that people burn for fuel. [[1](https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/General_Chemistry/Map%3A_Chemistry_-_The_Central_Science_(Brown_et_al.)/18%3A_Chemistry_of_the_Environment/18.04%3A_Chemistry_of_the_Troposphere)]
-   Another important process is the oxidizing capacity of the troposphere. Pollutants, whether emitted by natural or anthropogenic sources, influence the climate system. The oxidizing capacity of the troposphere plays an important role in removing these pollutants from the atmosphere [[2](https://www.atmosp.physics.utoronto.ca/people/loic/chemistry.html)].

### Atmospheric Flow

-   Atmospheric flow refers to the movement of air in the atmosphere.
-   The troposphere experiences both zonal flow, which is the east-west movement of air, and meridional flow, which is the north-south movement of air [[3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troposphere)].
-   Atmospheric flow is important in the distribution of pollutants throughout the atmosphere and in the transport of weather patterns.

### Key Points:

-   The troposphere is the lowest layer of the atmosphere, extending from Earth's surface to about 11-13 km at the equator and about 8 km at the poles.
-   The troposphere is composed mainly of nitrogen and oxygen, with trace amounts of other gases.
-   The troposphere is characterized by a decrease in temperature with altitude, with a constant temperature at the tropopause.
-   Important chemical processes in the troposphere include the formation of sulfuric acid and the oxidizing capacity of the atmosphere.
-   The movement of air in the troposphere is important in the distribution of pollutants and the transport of weather patterns.


## Stratosphere

The stratosphere is the second layer of the Earth's atmosphere located above the troposphere, extending from about 10 to 50 km (6 to 31 miles) above the surface of the Earth. It is a region of intense interactions among radiative, dynamical, and chemical processes, and where horizontal mixing of gaseous components proceeds much more rapidly than does vertical mixing [[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratosphere)]. Below are some key points about the stratosphere and its chemistry.

### Ozone Layer

-   The infamous ozone layer is found within the stratosphere, and it is responsible for protecting the Earth from harmful ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun.
-   Ozone molecules in the stratosphere absorb high-energy ultraviolet (UV) light from the Sun, converting the UV energy into heat [[1](https://scied.ucar.edu/learning-zone/atmosphere/layers-earths-atmosphere)].
-   The ozone layer forms naturally as a result of the photodissociation of molecular oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) by UV radiation, which produces oxygen atoms (O) that then react with other oxygen molecules to form ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) [[5](https://byjus.com/chemistry/stratosphere/)].

### Nitrogen Oxides and N<sub>2</sub>O

-   The stratosphere is a net photochemical source of NO<sub>y</sub> (NO, NO<sub>2</sub>, and other related compounds) and a net photochemical sink of N<sub>2</sub>O.
-   About 90% of the total loss of N<sub>2</sub>O in the stratosphere occurs via its photolysis by ultraviolet radiation yielding N<sub>2</sub> and excited atomic oxygen (O<sup>(1D)</sup>), which does not lead to NO production [[3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/chemistry/stratosphere)].
-   NO<sub>y</sub> plays a significant role in stratospheric chemistry, as it participates in many important reactions such as the depletion of ozone and the production of nitrogen oxides [[3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/chemistry/stratosphere)].

Note: The notation 1D refers to the electronic configuration of the oxygen atom, where the electron is in a particular excited state with a specific amount of energy.

N<sub>2</sub>O + hv → N<sub>2</sub> + O <sup>(1D)</sup>
( λ < 230nm: λ is the wavelength )

### Other Chemical Species

-   The stratosphere contains other chemical species such as water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, and hydrogen. These species are important in regulating the stratospheric temperature and composition [[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratosphere)].
-   The chemical composition of the stratosphere varies with latitude, altitude, and season [[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratosphere)].

1.  NO (nitric oxide)
2.  NO<sub>2</sub> (nitrogen dioxide)
3.  NO<sub>3</sub> (nitrogen trioxide)
4.  N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> (dinitrogen pentoxide)
5.  HNO<sub>3</sub> (nitric acid)
6.  HO<sub>2</sub>NO<sub>2</sub> (peroxynitric acid)
7.  ClONO<sub>2</sub> (chlorine nitrate)
8.  BrONO<sub>2</sub> (bromine nitrate)
9.  NOy = NO + NO<sub>2</sub> + NO<sub>3</sub> + 2N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> + HNO<sub>3</sub> + HO<sub>2</sub>NO<sub>2</sub> + ClONO<sub>2</sub> + BrONO<sub>2</sub> 
   (total reactive nitrogen NOy)


### Stratospheric Circulation

-   The stratospheric circulation is characterized by large-scale motions that transport air from the tropics to the poles and vice versa. These motions are driven by the absorption of solar radiation by ozone, which creates a temperature gradient that drives the circulation [[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratosphere)].
-   The stratosphere is also affected by natural and anthropogenic disturbances such as volcanic eruptions and human-induced emissions of gases and particles [[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratosphere)].

### Key Points

-   The stratosphere is the second layer of the Earth's atmosphere located above the troposphere.
-   The ozone layer, which protects the Earth from harmful UV radiation, is found in the stratosphere.
-   The stratosphere is a region of intense interactions among radiative, dynamical, and chemical processes.
-   NO<sub>y</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>O

## Mesosphere

The mesosphere is the layer of the Earth's atmosphere located between the stratosphere and the thermosphere. It extends from about 50 to 85 km (31 to 53 miles) above the Earth's surface.

### Characteristics

- The mesosphere is the highest layer of the atmosphere in which the gases are all mixed up rather than being layered by their mass. [[1](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/mesosphere/en/)]
- The temperature decreases with height throughout the mesosphere. The coldest temperatures in Earth's atmosphere, about -90°C (-130°F), are found near the top of this layer. [[2](https://scied.ucar.edu/learning-zone/atmosphere/mesosphere)]
- The decrease in temperature with height is due to the decrease in solar heating from the stratosphere. [[3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/chemistry/mesosphere)]
- Temperature decreases as altitude increases. It begins at the top of the stratosphere (sometimes called the stratopause), and ends at the mesopause, which is the coldest part of Earth's atmosphere, with temperatures below −143°C (−225°F; 130 K). [[4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesosphere)]
- Meteors burn up in the mesosphere, and the thermosphere starts just above the mesosphere and extends to 600 kilometers (372 miles) high. Aurora and satellites occur in this layer. [[5](https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_Chemistry/Chemistry_for_Changing_Times_(Hill_and_McCreary)/13%3A_Air/13.02%3A_Earth's_Atmosphere-_Divisions_and_Composition)]

### Chemistry

- The mesosphere is a relatively unexplored region, but studies have shown that it contains a variety of chemical species, including metals and free radicals. [[3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/chemistry/mesosphere)]
- Hydroxyl radical (OH) is one of the most important chemical species in the mesosphere. It is formed by the reaction of ozone with hydrogen atoms and plays a key role in the chemistry of the mesosphere. [[3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/chemistry/mesosphere)]
- The mesosphere is the layer of the atmosphere where the concentration of ions is the highest. The ions are formed by the ionization of molecules and atoms due to the absorption of high-energy radiation from the Sun. [[3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/chemistry/mesosphere)]
- In the mesosphere, sodium (Na) and iron (Fe) atoms are the most common metals present. They are believed to originate from the ablation of meteoroids that enter the Earth's atmosphere. [[3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/chemistry/mesosphere)]

## Thermosphere

The thermosphere is a region of Earth's atmosphere that extends from the mesopause (the upper boundary of the mesosphere) to 690 kilometers (429 miles) above the Earth's surface. This layer is located above the mesosphere and below the exosphere.

### Temperature

-   The temperature in the thermosphere can reach up to 4,500 degrees Fahrenheit, due to the absorption of x-rays and ultraviolet radiation by the thinly scattered molecules of gas in this region [[1](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/thermosphere/en/)].
-   The extremely high temperatures in this layer occasionally exceed 2000 K [[5](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/chemistry/thermosphere)].

### Chemistry

-   The chemistry in the thermosphere is dominated by the heat produced by the absorption of solar radiation [[5](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/chemistry/thermosphere)].
-   The absorption of solar radiation by the gases in the thermosphere, such as nitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>) and oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>), creates highly energized atoms and molecules. These highly energized atoms and molecules can then collide with other atoms and molecules, leading to various chemical reactions [[1](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/thermosphere/en/)].
-   One of the most significant chemical processes in the thermosphere is the ionization of gases. When highly energetic photons and particles, such as ultraviolet light and cosmic rays, collide with gas molecules in the thermosphere, they can strip electrons from the molecules, creating ions [[3](https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/parts-atmosphere/)].
-   The most common ions in the thermosphere are O<sup>+</sup>, N<sup>+</sup>, and O<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup> [[4](https://scied.ucar.edu/learning-zone/atmosphere/thermosphere)].
-   The ionization of gases in the thermosphere creates the Earth's ionosphere, which is composed of several regions and shares the same space as the thermosphere [[4](https://scied.ucar.edu/learning-zone/atmosphere/thermosphere)].

## Exosphere

The exosphere is the outermost layer of the Earth's atmosphere and is the upper limit of the atmosphere. It begins from approximately 2,300,000 ft to 3,280,000 ft above the surface and extends to merge with interplanetary space. The exosphere is about 10,000 km or 6,200 miles thick, making it about as wide as the Earth. The top boundary of Earth's exosphere extends about halfway to the Moon [[4](https://www.thoughtco.com/exosphere-definition-and-facts-4129101)].

### Composition

-   Hydrogen is the most abundant element in the exosphere. It dominates the thin atmosphere of the exosphere [[5](https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/parts-atmosphere/)].
-   Only trace amounts of helium, carbon dioxide, oxygen, and other gases are present in the exosphere [[5](https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/parts-atmosphere/)].

### Chemistry

-   The exosphere is almost a vacuum and is similar in many ways to the airless void of outer space [[2](https://scied.ucar.edu/learning-zone/atmosphere/exosphere)].
-   The temperature of the exosphere is very high, but since the density is very low, it is difficult to measure the temperature using a thermometer [[1](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/exosphere/en/)].
-   Atoms and molecules in the exosphere are highly energized due to the high temperature and collisions with energetic particles from the Sun [[3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/exosphere)].
-   The exosphere is affected by the Earth's magnetic field and the solar wind. Charged particles from the solar wind can interact with the exosphere and lead to the production of ions and other charged particles [[3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/exosphere)].
