Notes are here for my convenience, but I like to think they could help others, so they're public.

### Usage

#### Easy way

1. [Download Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) - The editor I used to create these files.
2. [Download entire git repo](https://github.com/LagSlug/Notes/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) (that's what you're looking at).
3. Extract the .zip file to any folder (the default name is "Notes-main", which is fine).
4. Install Obsidian.
5. Find the "Open folder as vault" button. 
   Choose the subfolder named "Notes-main", which will be found inside the extracted folder from step 3.
   
- Note: both the parent folder and the subfolder will likely be named "Notes-main".
   
#### Hard way

1. Follow the above steps, but replace steps 2 and 3 by installing a git client and pulling the git repo to your local environment.
