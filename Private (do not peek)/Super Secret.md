I'm sorry for what
has hurt you, but I love you,
because you are joy

For what hurt you then,
for what drove you to madness,
does it love you back?

A stream will eat stone, 
and the stone will disappear, 
and so will the stream.

Have you seen a bird?
Are they real? Can anything.. 
be so beautiful?

Moonless starry nights, 
The talk of the trees.. but wait.. 
they speak Japanese?
