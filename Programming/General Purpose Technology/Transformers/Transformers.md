# 1. Overview

- Deep learning architecture is well suited for natural language processing (NLP) tasks.
- Introduced in the paper "Attention Is All You Need" by Vaswani et al. in 2017.
- Captures complex relationships between words in a sequence.
- Good at capturing long-range dependencies compared to recurrent neural networks (RNNs).
- Incorporates positional encoding to provide information about word positions.


# 2. Self-Attention Mechanism

- Weighs the importance of words in a sequence.
- Compares each word to every other word in the sequence.
- Calculates attention scores based on similarity between words.
- Attention scores represent relevance or importance.
- Captures dependencies between words regardless of distance.
- Allows the model to focus on relevant parts of the input.
- Overcomes the limitations of sequential processing in traditional models.
- Enables comprehensive understanding of word relationships.
