1. Initialize the react application.
   
```bash
npx create-react-app glados --template typescript
```

- Note that a "." instead of an application name will initialize the project in the current directory, instead of creating a named subdirectory.

2. Enter the newly created directory.

```bash
cd glados
```

3. Install dependencies.

```bash
npm install electron electron-builder wait-on concurrently --save-dev
```
