- A `Makefile` is a file used by the `make` build automation tool.
- It describes the relationships among files in your program and provides commands for updating them.
- The `makefile` contains a set of `rules`. A `rule` generally includes a `target`, `prerequisites`, and a `recipe`.
- `Targets` are usually the names of files that are generated by a program, often an executable.
- `Prerequisites` are files or `targets` that must exist before a `target` can be built.
- `Recipes` are sequences of commands that `make` uses to create or update the `target`.
- `Makefiles` can be used to compile source code into executable programs or libraries, or to automate other repetitive tasks.
- They allow developers to organize and automate the process of building software, saving time and reducing potential for errors.
- They are commonly used in C and C++ development, but they can be used with any language or task where you need to create specific files from source files.
