- <u>Allpass filters</u> are mathematical functions that affect the phase response of a signal while keeping its magnitude unchanged.
- Allpass functions introduce a frequency-dependent delay to the signal, altering the timing or phase relationship of different frequency components.
- They do not change the relative amplitudes of the frequencies in the signal.
- Allpass filters are commonly used in audio effects like reverberation, equalization, and phaser effects.
- They can be represented by transfer functions in the frequency domain and introduce a varying delay or phase shift in the time domain.
- Allpass functions are used to modify the spatial characteristics of sounds, create special effects, and in applications like room simulation and acoustic modeling.

# Uses

1. Phase correction: When sampling an analog signal, the resulting digital signal may have phase distortions due to the sampling process. Allpass filters can be employed to compensate for these phase distortions and restore the original phase relationship of the signal.
    
2. Reverberation and spatial effects: Allpass filters are often utilized in digital reverberation algorithms to create a sense of space and simulate the acoustic characteristics of different environments. By introducing frequency-dependent delays, allpass filters contribute to the perception of reflections and enhance the spatial quality of the sound.
    
3. Equalization: Allpass filters can be incorporated into digital equalizers to manipulate the phase response of specific frequency bands. This allows for precise control over the phase characteristics of a signal, which can be useful for audio correction, sound shaping, and achieving specific tonal qualities.
    
4. Time-based effects: Allpass filters are integral components in various time-based audio effects like phasers, flangers, and chorus effects. These effects rely on modulating the phase relationship between multiple delayed copies of a signal to create distinct sound textures and movement.
