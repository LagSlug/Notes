### Postfix vs Suffix

 -  Postfix relates to the notation of placing operators after operands, 
 -  Suffix relates to the part of a file name after the dot symbol indicating the file type.

1.  Postfix: typically refers to a notation where operators are placed after their operands. For example, in the expression "2 3 +", the addition operator is placed after the operands "2" and "3". Postfix notation is also known as Reverse Polish Notation (RPN).
    
2.  Suffix: generally refers to a part of a file name that comes after the dot (.) symbol, indicating the file type or format. For example, in the file name "document.txt", the suffix is "txt", which signifies a plain text file.
