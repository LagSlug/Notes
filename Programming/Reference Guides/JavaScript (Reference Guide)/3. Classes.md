- A `class` is a syntactical construct that defines a blueprint for creating objects with shared properties and methods.

- Classes are well suited for Object Oriented Programming.

Example

- Assume that the cow is a perfect sphere of uniform density.

```TypeScript

class Cow {
	name: string;
	constructor(name: string) {
		this.name = name;
	}
	moo() {
		console.log('moo');
	}
}

```

### Extends

- A class can be extended by another class, creating a subclass.
- The `prototype` property of the ParentClass must be an `Object` or `null`.
- A non-object `prototype` is ignored by the `new` operator.
