### 1)    $\frac{1}{x(1-x)} \geq 4$  

We are given that $0 < x < 1$. We want to prove that $\frac{1}{x(1-x)} \geq 4$.

We start by multiplying both sides of the inequality by $x(1-x)$, which is positive for $0 < x < 1$:
$$\frac{1}{x(1-x)} \cdot x(1-x) \geq 4 \cdot x(1-x)$$

Simplifying the left-hand side gives:

$$1 \geq 4x(1-x)$$

Expanding the right-hand side gives:

$$1 \geq 4x - 4x^2$$

We can rewrite this as:

$$4x^2 - 4x + 1 \geq 0$$

This quadratic expression can be factored as $(2x - 1)^2 \geq 0$, which is always true. Therefore, we have proven that $\frac{1}{x(1-x)} \geq 4$ for any real number $x$ such that $0 < x < 1$.
