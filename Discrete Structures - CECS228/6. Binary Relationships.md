# 6.0 Introduction

- A binary relation is a way of expressing a relationship between two sets.

- The term "binary" is used to describe a relation that is a subset of the Cartesian product of two sets.

### University Enrollment

- Suppose we have a university with a set of students $S$ and a set of classes $C$.
- A relation $E$ can be defined between $s \in S$ and $c \in C$ to indicate whether a student $s$ is enrolled in a class $c$.
- $sEc$ means that student $s$ is enrolled in class $c$.
- It is possible for a student to be enrolled in more than one class, and for a class to have more than one student enrolled in it.
- If a student $s$ is not currently enrolled in any classes, then there is no class $c$ such that $sEc$.

### Infinite Sets

- Relations can be defined on infinite sets by specifying a rule or condition that determines whether two elements in the set are related to each other.

<u>For example</u>
- The relation C between ℝ and ℤ can be defined as:
$$
xCy \text{ if } |x - y| \leq 1
$$
- The relationship $xCy$ exists if the distance between real number $x$ and integer $y$ is at most $1$.

### Binary Relations with Arrow Diagrams

- If two finite sets, $A$ and $B$, have a binary relation $R$ between them, $R$ can be represented as a list of ordered pairs or in an arrow diagram.

- In the arrow diagram representation, the elements of $A$ are listed on the left and the elements of $B$ are listed on the right.

- An arrow is drawn from each element a ∈ A to its related element b ∈ B, indicating the relation R between them where $aRb$.

<u>Example</u>
let I = { Butterfly, Wasp, Bee, Moth }
    F = { Hawaiian, Lotus, Daisy, Orchid, Star }
    Relation: iPf if insect i ∈ I pollinates flower f ∈ F

P = {
  (Butterfly, Hawaiian), (Butterfly, Lotus), (Butterfly, Daisy),
  (Butterfly, Orchid), (Butterfly, Star),
  (Bee, Daisy), (Bee, Orchid), (Bee, Star),
  (Moth, Star)
}

### Matrix Representation

- In mathematics, a binary relation between two sets $A$ and $B$ can be represented using a matrix.
  
- This <u>matrix representation</u> is a 2-dimensional array of numbers, with |A| rows and |B| columns.
  
- Each row of the matrix corresponds to an element of A, while each column corresponds to an element of B.
  
- A relationship between $a ∈ A$ and $b ∈ B$ is represented by a value of 1 in the row of $a$ and the column of $b$, otherwise the cell value will be 0.

<u>Example</u>
let I = { Butterfly, Wasp, Bee, Moth }
    F = { Hawaiian, Lotus, Daisy, Orchid, Star }
    Relation: iPf if insect i ∈ I pollinates flower f ∈ F

P = {
  (Butterfly, Hawaiian), (Butterfly, Lotus), (Butterfly, Daisy),
  (Butterfly, Orchid), (Butterfly, Star),
  (Bee, Daisy), (Bee, Orchid), (Bee, Star),
  (Moth, Star)
}

### Manufacturing Requirements

- The requirements for a manufacturing plant that needs to fulfill a stream of orders can be represented by a binary relation between the set of all orders and the set of machines in the plant.

- Each order is related to a machine if that order requires the use of that machine.

- This binary relation can be used to find an efficient schedule for the orders, ensuring that machines are not needed for more than one order at the same time.

- By representing the requirements as a relation, it is easier to analyze the dependencies between orders and machines and optimize the production process accordingly.

### Binary Relation on a Set

- A <u>binary relation on a set</u> $A$ is a subset of $A x A$, consisting of ordered pairs of elements from $A$.
  
- $A$ and $B$ can be the same set.
  
- The set $A$ is called the <u>domain</u> of the binary relation.
  
- Binary relations on the same set can be useful in expressing properties of elements within the set, such as divisibility or partial ordering.

### Finite Set Relationships with Arrow Diagrams

- An arrow diagram for a relation R on a finite set A shows the elements of A with arrows connecting related elements. 
- A <u>self-loop</u> is used to show an element related to itself.
  
#### The Hamster King
In the jungle, the mighty jungle, the hamster belongs to a set.

let A = { Lion, Zebra, Gazelle, Crocodile, Hamster, Polar Bear, Seal }
    P = { (Lion, Zebra), (Lion, Gazelle), 
				     (Crocodile, Gazelle), (Crocodile, Lion),
				     (Hamster, Hamster),
				     (Polar Bear, Seal)
    }
