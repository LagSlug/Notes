# 1.6 Predicates and quantifiers
-   Many mathematical statements contain variables.
-   "x is an odd number" is not a proposition as it doesn't have well-defined truth value until x is specified.
-   The truth value of the statement can be expressed as a function P(x) where P is the predicate and x is the variable.
-   A logical statement whose truth value depends on variables is called a predicate.
-   Example: If P(x) = "x is an odd number", then P(5) = "5 is an odd number" is a proposition with well-defined truth value.
-   The domain of a variable in a predicate is the set of all possible values for the variable.
-   Example: The natural domain for variable x in "x is an odd number" is the set of all integers.
-   If domain is not clear from context, it should be defined as part of the predicate definition.

-   Predicates are not limited to mathematical statements.
-   An example of a non-mathematical predicate: "The city has a population over 1,000,000" where the city is the variable and the domain is all cities in the US.
-   When a city is assigned, the statement becomes either true or false. E.g. "New York has a population over 1,000,000" is true.
-   A statement containing a variable can still be considered a predicate even if it's true for all values in the domain.
-   Example: "x + 1 > 1" is true for all positive integers but is still considered a predicate.

### Universal quantifier

-   A predicate becomes a proposition with well-defined truth value if all variables are assigned values from their domains.
-   Predicate can also become proposition by using quantifier.
-   The logical statement "∀x P(x)" means "for all x, P(x)" or "for every x, P(x)".
-   The statement "∀x P(x)" asserts that P(x) is true for every possible value of x in its domain.
-   The symbol "∀" is a universal quantifier and the statement "∀x P(x)" is called universally quantified statement.
-   "∀x P(x)" is a proposition as it is either true or false.
-   "∀x P(x)" is true if and only if P(n) is true for every n in the domain of variable x.

If the domain is a finite set of elements {a1, a2, ..., ak}, then:

-   The equivalence symbol means that two expressions have the same truth value.
-   The proposition ∀x A(x) means "Every element in the domain meets the condition A(x)".
-   To establish that ∀x A(x) is true, it requires proof for each and every element in the domain.
-   Some universally quantified statements can be shown to be true by proving the predicate holds for an arbitrary element from the domain.
-   "Arbitrary element" means nothing is assumed about the element, only that it is in the domain.
