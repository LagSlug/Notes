Intersection, Difference, and Equivalence are terms used in set theory to define relationships between sets. Here are concise bullet points explaining each term:

-   Intersection: the intersection of two sets is the set of elements that are common to both sets.
-   Difference: the difference of two sets is the set of elements that are in one set but not in the other.
-   Equivalence: two sets are equivalent if they have the same number of elements, i.e., they have a one-to-one correspondence.

Here's an example to illustrate these terms:

Let A = {1, 2, 3, 4} and B = {3, 4, 5, 6}

-   A ∩ B (Intersection): {3, 4}
-   A - B (Difference): {1, 2}
-   B - A (Difference): {5, 6}
-   A ≡ B (Equivalence): A and B are not equivalent because they have different numbers of elements.
