-   Basic mathematical concepts useful in proofs
-   Definition of even and odd integers with algebraic expressions.

### Even and odd integers

<div style="display: inline-block; border: 1px solid; padding: 10px 40px 10px 10px; ">
	<div style="white-space: pre;">
		An integer x is even if there is an integer k such that x = 2k. 
		An integer x is odd if there is an integer k such that x = 2k+1
	</div>
</div>

### Parity

-   Parity refers to the odd or even nature of a number.
-   If two numbers are both odd or both even, they have the same parity.
-   If one number is odd and the other is even, then they have opposite parity.

<div style="display: inline-block; border: 1px solid; padding: 10px 40px 10px 10px; ">
	<div style="white-space: pre;">
		O(x): x is odd
		P(x, y): x and y have same parity
		
		P(x, y) = O(x) ↔ O(y)
	</div>
</div>

### Rational numbers

-   A rational number can be expressed as the ratio of two integers, where the denominator is not zero.
-   The choice of integers used to represent a rational number is not necessarily unique.
-   For instance, the rational number 0.5 can be represented as 1/2 or 2/4.

### Divides

-   An integer x can divide another integer y if x is not zero and y can be written as k times x, where k is also an integer.
-   We use the symbol x|y to mean that x <u>divides</u> y. 
-   If x cannot divide y, we use the symbol x∤y.
-   When y is a <u>multiple</u> of x, it means that x is one of the numbers that can divide y. 
-   We call x a <u>factor</u> or <u>divisor</u> of y.

### Prime and composite numbers

-   An integer n is called a <u>prime number</u> if it is greater than 1 and only 1 and n can divide it.
-   An integer n is called a <u>composite number</u> if it is greater than 1 and can be divided by at least one positive integer other than 1 and itself.

-  There is no known formula that can determine whether a given number x is prime or not.
-  However, there are algorithms that can test whether a number is prime, such as the Sieve of Eratosthenes and the Miller-Rabin primality test.

### Inequalities

-   When we compare two numbers x and c, one of three things is true: 
			x < c
			x = c
			x > c
			
-   We use symbols like <, >, ≤, and ≥ to show how x and c are related. 
-   For example, x ≥ c means x is at least as big as c, and x ≤ c means x is at most as big as c.

-   If we say "not x < c", that means x is <u>at least</u> as big as c (x ≥ c) or x is <u>greater than or equal to</u> c. 
-   if we say "not x > c", that means x is <u>at most</u> as big as c (x ≤ c) or is <u>less than or equal to</u> c.

-   A <u>positive</u> number is greater than zero, a <u>negative</u> number is less than zero, a <u>non-negative</u> number is greater than or equal to zero, and a <u>non-positive</u> number is less than or equal to zero.

# 2.2 Introduction to proofs

### Theorems

-   In math, we try to prove things called theorems. A theorem is like a big puzzle piece that we have to fit into place.
-   To prove a theorem, we use logic and reasoning to show that it's true. We start with things that we know are true, and use them to figure out if the theorem is also true.
-   Sometimes we have to use special rules called axioms, which are things we just assume are true, like "if A = B and B = C, then A = C".
-   Proofs are important in computer science too! We use them to make sure that computer programs work correctly, or to check that a system for keeping secrets (called a cryptosystem) is safe from hackers.

##### Example Theorem

Statement
	Every positive integer is less than or equal to its square.

Expression
	∀x ( ( x > 0 ) → ( x ≦ x<sup>2</sup> ) )

### Theorems that are universal or existential statements

Universal statements:

-   Most theorems are universal statements, which assert something about all elements in a set.
-   Universal statements might not use words like "for all" or "for every".
-   Example: "The sum of two positive real numbers is strictly greater than the average of the two numbers."
-   In logic, this statement can be expressed as: 
  $$
	\displaylines{
		 ∀x ∀y (\ (\ x > 0 ∧ y > 0\ ) → (\ x + y\ ) > \frac{(\ x + y\ )}{2}\ )	
	}
$$
Existential statements:

-   Some theorems are existential statements, which assert the existence of a number or object with certain properties.
-   Example: "There is an integer that is equal to its square."
-   In logic, this statement can be expressed as: 
  $$
	\displaylines{
		 ∃x (x = x^2)		
	}
$$

Understanding whether a theorem is a universal or existential statement is an important first step in proving that the theorem is true.

##### Example: perfect square

- A number n is a perfect square if n = k<sup>2</sup> for some integer k.
- Existentially: "There is a perfect square that is the sum of two non-zero perfect squares".

Let
	P(x): x is a perfect square

Expression
	∃x∃y∃z ((P(x) = P(y) + P(z)) ∧ ( y ≠ 0 ∧ z ≠ 0 ))

### Proofs of universal statements: proofs by exhaustion

-   Small domains may be easier to prove by checking each element individually.
-   This kind of proof is called a <u>proof by exhaustion</u>.

#### Example

<div style="display: inline-block; border: 1px solid; padding: 10px 40px 10px 10px; ">
	<div style="white-space: pre;">
		If n ∈ { -1, 0, 1 }, then n<sup>2</sup> = | n |
		
		Check the equality for each possible value of n:

		n = -1:     (-1)<sup>2</sup> = 1 = |-1|
		n = 0:      (0)<sup>2</sup> = 0 = |0|
		n = 1:      (1)<sup>2</sup> = 1 = |1|
		
		All equalities are true.
	</div>
</div>

### Proofs of universal statements: universal generalization

-   Universal statement is difficult to prove individually for each element in the domain
-   Universal generalization is the most common method for proving universal statements
-   A proof using universal generalization names an arbitrary object in the domain and proves the statement for that object
-   "Arbitrary" means nothing is assumed about the object other than the assumptions given in the statement.

<div style="display: inline-block; border: 1px solid; padding: 10px 40px 10px 10px; ">
	<div style="white-space: pre;">
		<b>Theorem</b>
			Every positive integer is less than or equal to its square.

		Proof
			Let x be an (arbitrary) integer such that x > 0
			So x must be greater than or equal to 1.	
			( x ≧ 1 )
			∴	x<sup>2</sup> ≧  x			
	</div>
</div>

### Counterexamples

-   Proving a universal statement for each element in a large or infinite domain is impractical.
-   Giving examples to prove a universal statement is unreliable because there can always be a counterexample that was not tried.
-   A counterexample is an assignment of values to variables that shows that a universal statement is false.
-   The only way to be certain that a universal statement is true is a general proof that holds for all objects in the domain.
-   A mathematician may search for a counterexample showing that an unproven statement is false or a proof showing that it is true

<div style="display: inline-block; border: 1px solid; padding: 10px 40px 10px 10px; ">
	<div style="white-space: pre;">
		Erroneous Theorem
			If n is an integer greater than 1, then (1.1)<sup>n</sup> &lt; n<sup>10</sup>.
