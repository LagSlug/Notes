# 5.0 Boolean Algebra

- Boolean algebra is a system for working with variables that have values of either 0 or 1.
- Boolean algebra is closely related to propositional logic.
- The definitions for Boolean operations are similar to logical operations but with different notation.
- In Boolean algebra, 1 represents T and 0 represents F.

# 5.1 Introduction to Boolean Algebra

### Operations

- Boolean operations are similar to propositional operations.

#### Multiplication

- Boolean multiplication is denoted by • and follows the same rules as regular multiplication.
- The results of Boolean multiplication are the same as the logical "and" operation.

| Boolean • | Logical ∧ |
|:---------:|:---------:|
| 0 • 0 = 0 | F ∧ F = F |
| 0 • 1 = 0 | F ∧ T = F |
| 1 • 0 = 0 | T ∧ F = F |
| 1 • 1 = 1 | T ∧ T = T |

#### Addition

- Boolean addition uses the symbol "+" and follows the same rules as standard addition.
- Except 1 + 1 ≠ 2, since 2 is not an element of {0, 1}.
- The results of Boolean addition are the same as the logical "or" operation.

|  Boolean + | Logical ∨ |
|:----------:|:---------:|
|  0 + 0 = 0 | F ∨ F = F |
|  0 + 1 = 1 | F ∨ T = T |
|  1 + 0 = 1 | T ∨ F = T |
|  1 + 1 = 1 | T ∨ T = T |

#### Complement

- Complement of an element is denoted by a bar symbol.
- Complementing a Boolean value is similar to applying the "not" operation in logic.
- The expression under a complement operation is evaluated before the operation is applied.

| Boolean complement | Logical ¬ |
|:------------------:|:---------:|
|        0 = 1       |   ¬F = T  |
|        1 = 0       |   ¬T = F  |

### George Boole's and Digital Logic

-   George Boole defined Boolean algebra in the mid-19th century.
-   Computers use 0s and 1s as their native language.
-   Boolean algebra is the basis of computer circuit design.
-   Vacuum tubes were used to store information as on or off states (1s and 0s).
-   Today, high and low voltage states represent 1s and 0s in computer components.
-   The foundation of computer circuitry is still based on Boolean algebra.
-   The field of computer science that designs computer circuitry is called <u>digital logic</u>.
  
### Claude Shannon and Telephone Switching Networks

- <u>Claude Shannon</u> noticed the connection between Boolean algebra and telephone switching networks as a graduate student at MIT in the late 1930s.
- He showed that Boolean algebra could be used to simplify electronic switches used in telephone exchanges at the time.
- Shannon's study focused on electrical circuits, which have a light that illuminates if the circuit forms a closed loop.
- A circuit contains switches that are either closed or open, and the setting of the switches determines whether the circuit is closed.

### Boolean Logic in Circuits
#### And Circuit

- When both switches are closed, the LED will recieve current.

#### Or Circuit
![[Discrete Structures - CECS228/attachments/or-switch-circuit-diagram.svg]]

- When either switch is closed, the LED will recieve current.

### Variables and Expressions

- <u>Boolean variables</u> have a value of 1 or 0.
- <u>Boolean expressions</u> are built up by applying Boolean operations to Boolean variables or constants.
- The value of a Boolean expression can depend on the order of operations.

### Operator Precedence

- Precedence rules exist to determine the correct order of operations.

| Precedence |                     Boolean Operator                      | Name                                  |
|:----------:|:---------------------------------------------------------:|:------------------------------------- |
|     0      |                           a ⋅ b                           | Multiplication                        |
|     1      |                           a + b                           | Addition                              |
|     \*     |                        (a + b) ⋅ c                        | Parentheses override precedence rules |
|     \*\*     | a + <span style="text-decoration: overline;">b + c</span> | Complement are given precedence as parentheses                                      |

### Best Practices

- It is good practice to use parentheses for readability when applying the complement operation, except when it is applied to a single variable or the entire expression.
- When both inputs to the • operation are variables, the expression x • y can be written as xy for more compact expressions.

### Boolean Equivalence

-   Equivalence between two Boolean expressions is determined by checking if they have the same value for every possible combination of assigned variable values.
-   The symbol (≡) denotes logical equivalence in propositional logic, while (=) is used in Boolean algebra.
-   Boolean algebra follows the same laws (pairs of equivalent expressions) as propositional logic.

- Boolean algebra laws apply similarly to propositional logic laws to demonstrate equivalence between two Boolean expressions.

- The power set of A satisfies the conditions of a Boolean algebra.
- The {0, 1} set along with complement, +, and • operations is also an instance of a Boolean algebra.
- The {0, 1} Boolean algebra is commonly used in modern digital logic.
- The term "Boolean algebra" can refer to either the {0, 1} set or a general class of sets and operations.
- It is important to be aware of both meanings to avoid confusion.

### Examples

##### 1 )      (<span style="text-decoration: overline;">x + 0</span>)( <span style="text-decoration: overline;">y</span> + <span style="text-decoration: overline;">z</span> )
$$
\begin{align}
	\text{Let $x = 0$, $y = 1$, $z = 0$ } \\ \\
	(\overline{x + 0})
	(\overline{y}+\overline{z}) &= (\overline{0 + 0})(\overline{1}+\overline{0}) \\ &= (\overline{0})(\overline{1}+\overline{0}) \\ &= (\overline{0})(0 + 1) \\ &= 1 (0 + 1) \\ &= 1\cdot 1 \\ &= 1 \end{align}
$$


##### 2 )      (a + <span style="text-decoration: overline;">b + c</span>) ⋅ d 

- The tuple (a, b, c, d) represents a 4-bit number, so each entry can be either 1 or 0.
- Since a 4-bit number has are 2<sup>4</sup> possible values, there are 16 possible values for (a, b, c, d) .
