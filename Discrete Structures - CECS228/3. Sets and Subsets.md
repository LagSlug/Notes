| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |:------------:| ------------------------------------- |
| Natural numbers  | N is the set of natural numbers, which includes all integers greater than or equal to 0.                                              | $\mathbb{N}$ | 0, 1, 2, 3, …                         |

# 3.1 Sets

- A <u>set</u> is a collection of objects
- Objects in a set are called <u>elements</u>
- Sets can contain elements of different varieties
- A set is defined by indicating which elements belong to it
- Equality between sets uses the equals sign "=", not the equivalance sign "≡".
   
### Roster Notation

- <u>Roster notation</u> is a way to define a set by listing its elements

<div style="display: inline-block; border: 1px solid; padding: 10px 40px 10px 10px; ">
	<div style="">
		<u style="margin-left: 20px; margin-top: 20px; display: block;">
			Roster notation
		</u>
		<div style="display: table;">
			<div style="display: table-row;">
				<div style="display: table-cell; white-space: pre;">
			S = { 2, 4, 6, 10 }
			E = { 1, 3, 5, ... , 99 }
			N = { 3, 6, 9, 12, .... }
				</div>
				<div style="display: table-cell; white-space: pre;">
			4 four member set
			odd numbers, 1 to 99
			multiples of 3, infinitely
				</div>
			</div>
		</div>
	</div>
</div>

- Ellipses (...) can be used to denote long sequences of numbers in a set
- A <u>finite set</u> can be numbered 1 through n for some positive integer n
- An <u>infinite set</u> is not finite
- Two sets are equal if they have exactly the same elements
- Order of elements is unimportant when defining a set

<div style="display: inline-block; border: 1px solid; padding: 0px 40px 0px 10px; ">
	<div style="white-space: pre;">
		<u>Example Sets</u>
		
		D = { 3, 4, 5 }
    N = { 5, 3, 4 }
    U = { 5, 3, 4, 6 }
		
		D = N 
		D ≠ U	
		
		6 ∈ U is true       6 ∈ N is false
		5 ∉ U is false    	 7 ∉ N is true
	</div>
</div>

### Empty Sets

- The <u>empty set</u>, also known as the <u>null set</u>, it contains no elements, and is represented by the symbol ∅ or { }.

<div style="display: inline-block; border: 1px solid; padding: 0px 40px 0px 10px; ">
	<div style="white-space: pre;">
		<u>Empty  Sets</u>
		
		D = { }
		E = ∅		
		
		<u>i.e.</u>
		a ∉ ∅
		"Any element *a* is not a part of the empty set."
	</div>
</div>

### Cardinality

- The <u>cardinality</u> of a finite set is the number of distinct elements.
- Cardinality of empty set |∅| is zero.
- Cardinality of an infinite set is infinity.

<div style="display: inline-block; border: 1px solid; padding: 0px 40px 0px 10px; ">
		<u style="display: block; margin-top: 20px; margin-left: 20px;">Cardinality</u>
	<div style="display: table;">
	<div style="display: table-row;">
		<div style="display: table-cell; white-space: pre;">
		S = { 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 }
		P = ∅
		L = { 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ... }
		</div>
		<div style="display: table-cell; white-space: pre;">
		| S | = 6
		| P | = 0
		| L | = ∞
		</div>
	</div>
</div>
</div>

### Positive and Negative Sets

|  Set Notation   | Description                                                                |
|:---------------:|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|       R+        | Set of all positive real numbers                                           |
|       Z+        | Set of all positive integers                                               |
|      x > 0      | x is positive                                                              |
|       R-        | Set of all negative real numbers                                           |
|       Z-        | Set of all negative integers                                               |
|      x < 0      | x is negative                                                              |
|        0        | Neither positive nor negative                                              |
|      x ≧ 0      | x is non-negative                                                          |
|      x ≦ 0      | x is non-positive                                                          |
| Natural numbers | Either defined as non-negative integers or positive integers (excluding 0) |


### Set Builder Notation

- <u>Set builder notation</u> is a method used to define a set by specifying that the set includes all elements in a larger set that also satisfy certain conditions. 

<div style="display: inline-block; border: 1px solid; padding: 20px 40px 20px 40px; ">
		<u>Set builder notation</u>
		<br /><br />
		<div style="display: table; ">
			<div style="display: table-row;">
				<div style="display: table-cell;">
					A = { x ∈ S : P(x) } <br />
					"all x in S such that P(x)"					
				</div>
				<div style="display: table-cell; padding-left: 50px">
					V = { m | m is a vegitarian meal } <br />
					"The set V includes all vegetarian meals. "
				</div>
			</div>
		</div>
	  <br />
		<div>
			D = &#123; x ∈ ℝ : | x | &lt;1 &#125; <br />
			"The set D is all real numbers between -1 and 1."
		</div>
</div>

- S is the larger set from which the elements in A are taken
- P(x) is some condition for membership in A
- The colon symbol ":" is read "such that"
-  "Such that" is also represented by the pipe symbol "|"
  
### Universal Set

- The <u>universal set</u> contains all elements mentioned in a particular context.
- It is usually denoted by the variable *U*.
	
<div style="display: inline-block; border: 1px solid;">
	<div style="white-space: pre-line; padding: 40px; padding-top: 0px;">
		<u>Example</u>
		
		In a discussion about the grades of students at a school, the universal set would be the set of all students at the school
	</div>
</div>	

### Venn Diagrams

- A rectangle represents the universal set U
- Oval shapes are used to denote sets within U
- Elements are drawn inside the oval if they are in the set represented by the oval

### Subset Relationships

- A is <u>subset</u> of B if every element in A is also an element of B 
  (A ⊆ B)
  
- A is not a subset of B if there is an element of A that is not an element of B 
  (A ⊈ B)
    
- Two sets are equal if and only if each is a subset of the other 
  (A = B if and only if A ⊆ B and B ⊆ A)
  
- A is a <u>proper subset</u> of B if A ⊆ B and there is an element of B that is not an element of A (A ⊂ B)
  
  <div style="display: inline-block; border: 1px solid;">
	<div style="white-space: pre-line; padding: 40px; padding-top: 0px;">
		<u>Note</u>
		
		For every set A: 		
		∅ ⊆ A ⊆ U
		
		The empty set is a subset of A,
		and A is a subset of the universal set.
	</div>
</div>	

# 3.2 Set of sets

- A set can have elements that are sets themselves.
- The empty set ∅ is not the same as { ∅ }.

<div style="display: inline-block; border: 1px solid;">
	<div style="white-space: pre-line; padding: 40px; padding-top: 0px;">
		<u>Example</u>
		
		 A = { { 1, 2 }, ∅, { 1, 2, 3 }, { 1 } }
     B = { 2 , ∅, { 1, 2, 3 }, { 1 } }
     
     <u>In set A</u>
         { 1, 2 } ∈ A 
				 1 ∉ A
				 
		 <u>In set B</u>
		      2 ∈ B  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; { 2 } ⊆ B
		      1 ∉ B  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; { 1 } ⊈ B
	</div>
</div>	

##### Power Set

- The <u>power set</u> of a set A, denoted P(A), is the set of all subsets of A.

<div style="display: inline-block; border: 1px solid;">
	<div style="white-space: pre-line; padding: 40px; padding-top: 0px;">
		<u>Example</u>
		A = { 1, 2, 3 }
		
		P(A) = { ∅, { 1 }, { 2 }, { 3 }, { 1, 2 }, { 1, 3 }, { 2, 3 }, { 1, 2, 3 } }
	</div>
</div>	

##### Cardinality of a Power Set

<div style="display: inline-block; border: 1px solid;">
	<div style="white-space: pre-line; padding: 40px; padding-top: 0px;">
		<u>Theorem</u>
		
		The cardinality of a power set is
		| P(A) | = 2<sup>n</sup>
		where A is a finite set of cardinality n.
		
		<u>Example I</u>
		A = { ♥, ☾, ★, ♣ }  
		| A | = 4
		
		P(A) = { ∅, { ♥ }, { ☾ }, ..., { ♥, ☾, ★, ♣ } }		
		| P(A) | = 2<sup>4</sup> = 16
		
		<u>Example II</u>
		B = ∅
		| B | = 0
		
		P(B) = { ∅ }
		| P(B) | = 2<sup>0</sup> = 1
	</div>
</div>	

# 3.3 Union and intersection

- Standard set operations allow for the creation of new sets from existing sets.
- These operations involve the combination of sets in various ways to define new sets.

### The set intersection operation

- The intersection of sets A and B is denoted as A ∩ B and read as "A intersect B".
- It returns a set of all elements that are common to both A and B.
- The result of the intersection operation is always a subset of both A and B, even if the returned set is empty.

![[Discrete Structures - CECS228/attachments/set intersection.svg]]
- C is the set of elements that A and B share.
- If A and B have no common elements, then their intersection is an empty set.

- The intersection operation can be used on infinite sets.
  
$$
\begin{aligned}
A &= \text{\{ x ∈ Z x is an integer multiple of 2 \}} \\
    
B &= \text{\{ x ∈ Z x is an integer multiple of 3 \}} \\
    
A ∩ B &= \text{\{ x ∈ Z x is an integer multiple of 6 \}}
\end{aligned}
$$
### The set union operation

- A union B, denoted A ∪ B, is the set of all elements that are elements of A or B.
- A ∪ B is read "A union B".
  
  ![[Discrete Structures - CECS228/attachments/set union.svg]]

- The definition for union uses the <u>inclusive or</u>, meaning that if an element is an element of both A and B, then it is also an element of A ∪ B.

<div style="display: inline-block; border: 1px solid; padding: 0px 40px 0px 10px; ">
 <h4 class="padding">Example</h4>
	<div style="white-space: pre; margin-top: -30px; padding-left: 20px;">
Consider the kind professor.

If a student receives an A on either of their first two midterms, 
they can skip the final exam. 

Sets A and B are defined as:
A = { x: student x received an A on midterm 1 }
B = { x: student x received an A on midterm 2 }

A ∪ B = { x: student x received an A on midterm 1 or midterm 2 }
A ∪ B = { x: student x may skip the final exam }
	</div>
</div>

- Set operations can be combined to define more sets, such as A ∪ (B ∩ C) which is the union of A and B ∩ C.
- Parentheses are crucial because (A ∪ B) ∩ C differs from A ∪ (B ∩ C).

#### Example: A ∩ b ∩ C
<div style="display: table;">
	<div style="display: table-row;">
		<div style="display: table-cell;">
			<img src="/Discrete Structures - CECS228/attachments/set tri-intersect.svg" />
		</div>
		<div style="display: table-cell; vertical-align: top; white-space: pre;">
			A ∩ B = G ∪ H
			B ∩ C = F ∪ H
			C ∩ A = E ∪ H
			
			A ∩ B ∩ C = H
		</div>
	</div>
</div>
Note:
- Only set H is a set of A ∩ b ∩ C.
- Sets E, F, and G are not subsets of the set H.
  
#### Example: A ∩ (B ∪ C)
<div style="display: table;">
	<div style="display: table-row;">
		<div style="display: table-cell;">
			<img src="/Discrete Structures - CECS228/attachments/set tri-union-intersect.svg" />
		</div>
		<div style="display: table-cell; vertical-align: top; white-space: pre;">
		 The intersection of A with the union of B and C
		 is the union of subsets H, E, and G.
		 
		 A ∩ (B ∪ C) = H ∪ E ∪ G
		</div>
	</div>
</div>
Note:
- Only the union of sets E, H, and G is a set of A ∩ (B ∪ C).
- Sets C, B, and F are not subsets of the  set E ∪ H ∪ G.
 
 
### Intersection and Union Sequence Notation

- The intersection, or union, of a sequence of sets A<sub>1</sub> to A<sub>n</sub> can be shown with a special notation. 
- The  "*i*=1" below the operator sign and "*n*" above it to indicate that the operation applies to all sets with integer indices *i* from 1 through *n*.

$$
\bbox[border: 1px solid; padding: 20px]{
	\begin{aligned}
	&\text{Intersection Sequence}\\
	\bigcap_{i=1}^n A_i = A_1 \cap A_2 \cap \cdots \cap A_n &= \{ x: x \in A_i ~~\mbox{for all}~~i
	~~\mbox{such that }~~ 1 \le i \le n \} \\
	&\text{Union Sequence} \\
	\bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i = A_1 \cup A_2 \cup \cdots \cup A_n &= \{ x: x \in A_i ~~\mbox{for some}~~i
~~\mbox{such that }~~  1 \le i \le n \}

	\end{aligned}
}
$$

#### Example: String Length

Consider the following set of 50 words:

| *1 - 10*   | *11 - 20*  | *21 - 30*   | *31 - 40* | *41 - 50* |
| -------- | -------- | --------- | ------- | ------- |
| Ballons  | Dripping | Meatballs | Plums   | Spread  |
| Balls    | Eggplant | Melons    | Poles   | Swollen |
| Banana   | Friction | Milkshake | Pound   | Taco    |
| Beaver   | Head     | Mounds    | Rack    | Throb   |
| Buns     | Holes    | Nuts      | Salami  | Tool    |
| Bush     | Hooters  | Package   | Sausage | Trim    |
| Cans     | Hose     | Peaches   | Screw   | Wad     |
| Cherry   | Jugs     | Pickle    | Shaft   | Weiner  |
| Cream    | Juicy    | Pipe      | Snatch  | Wet     |
| Cucumber | Knockers | Piston    | Split   | Wood    |

- The longest words in this list have 9 characters, they are: 
  meatballs and milkshake.
- The shortest words in this list have 3 characters, they are:
	wad and wet.

Define A to be the set of all listed words.
A = { Ballons, Balls, ..., Wet, Wood }

Define A<sub>j</sub> to be the subset of all listed words with length j.
A<sub>1</sub> = ∅
A<sub>2</sub> = ∅
A<sub>3</sub> = { Wad, Wet }
...
A<sub>9</sub> = { Meatballs, Milkshake }

- There are no words with length 1, so A<sub>1</sub> is an empty set.
  
We could write the intersection of all words in this list as:

$$
	\begin{aligned}
	\bigcap_{i=3}^9 A_i = 
	\text{\{ Wad, Wet \}} ∩ 
	\cdots ∩ 
	\text{\{ Meatballs, Milkshake \}}
	= ∅
	\end{aligned}
$$

- i = 3 signifies that the first set is A<sub>3</sub>
- n = 9 signifies that the last set is A<sub>9</sub>
- Since no two sets share any elements, the intersection of all subsets of A is an empty set.

For whatever strange reason, we could write a sequential union of word sets instead:

$$
	\begin{aligned}
	\bigcup_{i=7}^8 A_i &= 
	\text{\{ Ballons, ... , Swollen \}} ∩ 
	\text{\{ Cucumber, ... , Knockers \}} \\
	&= \text{\{ Ballons, Hooters, Package, Peaches, } \\
	& ~~~~~~~\text{ Sausage, Swollen, Cucumber, Dripping, } \\
	& ~~~~~~~\text{ Eggplant, Friction, Knockers \}}
	\end{aligned}
$$

For the sake of completion, the sequential union of all subsets of set A would be set A.

$$
	\begin{aligned}
	\bigcup_{i=1}^9 A_i &= 
	\text{\{ Wad, Wet \}} ∪ 
	\cdots ∪ 
	\text{\{ Meatballs, Milkshake \}} \\
	&= \text{\{ Wad, ... , Milkshake \}} = A 
	\end{aligned}
$$



# 3.4.0 Difference and Symmetric Difference

### Difference of Sets

- The difference between two sets A and B is the set of elements that are in A but not in B.
- The difference operator is the minus symbol "-".
- The difference operation is not commutative unless A ≡ B.
- If A ≡ B the difference is ∅.
    
#### Example: (A - B) - C
![[Discrete Structures - CECS228/attachments/set tri-difference.svg]]
Note:
- Striped regions are areas removed by application of the difference operator.
- The remaining subset of A contains all elements in common with B and C removed.

### Symmetric Difference of Sets

- The symmetric difference of sets A and B contains only the elements that belong exclusively to A or B, but not both.
- Its operator is the xor symbol "⊕".
- It is commutative, that is: A ⊕ B ≡ B ⊕ A.
- Logical Equivalence:
  
	A ⊕ B ≡ ( A - B ) ∪ ( B - A )

#### Example: (A ⊕ B) ⊕ C

First step:
![[Discrete Structures - CECS228/attachments/set tri-symmetric-difference-1.svg]]

Solution:
![[Discrete Structures - CECS228/attachments/set tri-symmetric-difference.svg]]

Note:
- Since the set D was removed by the A ⊕ B operation, it could then be replaced by the  symmetric difference operation of that resultant set with set C.



# 3.4.1 Set Complement Operation

- Recall that U is the symbol for the universal set.
  
- The <u>complement</u> of set A, denoted <span style="text-decoration: overline;">A</span>, is the set of all elements in U not in A.
- The complement of a set requires a well defined U.
- Logical equivalence:
  
  <span style="text-decoration: overline;">A</span> ≡ U - A

#### Example: Odd Compliments Even

<div style="display: inline-block; border: 1px solid; padding: 0px 40px 0px 10px; ">

- A <u>set identity</u> is an equation involving sets that is always true.
- It doesn't depend on the contents of the sets in the equation.
- It's similar to an equivalence in logic, which holds regardless of the truth values of individual variables.

# 3.6.0 Cartesian Products

### Ordered Pair
- An <u>ordered pair</u> is written as (x, y).
- The first entry of the ordered pair is x, and the second entry is y.
- The use of parentheses for an ordered pair indicates that the order of entries is significant.
- Two ordered pairs (x, y) and (u, w) are equal if and only if x = u and y = w.
- For example, (x, y) ≠ (y, x) unless x = y.

### Sets of Ordered Pairs
- Sets of ordered pairs may be written in Roster notation: { (a, a), (a, b), (b, a), (b, b) }
- The order in an unordered set does not matter, {x, y} is equal to {y, x}.

### A Cartesian Product is a Set of Ordered Pairs

- The <u>Cartesian product</u> of two sets A and B, denoted A x B, is the set of all ordered pairs in which the first entry is in A and the second entry is in B.
      
    A x B = { (a, b) : a ∈ A and b ∈ B }

- A x B is not equal to B x A, unless A = B or either A or B is empty.
- If A and B are finite sets, |A x B| = |A|⋅|B|.

### N-Fold Cartesian Product

- The Cartesian product of a set A with itself can be represented as A × A or A<sup>2</sup>.
- The Cartesian product can also be extended to more than two sets. For example: A × B × C.
  
- Generally, the Cartesian product of *n* sets, A<sub>1</sub>, A<sub>2</sub>, ..., A<sub>n</sub> is:
	 A<sub>1</sub> x A<sub>2</sub> x ... x A<sub>n</sub> = { ( a<sub>1</sub>, a<sub>2</sub>, ... , a<sub>n</sub>) : a<sub>i</sub> ∈ A<sub>i</sub> for all i such that 1 ≤ i ≤ n }

	<div style="white-space: pre;">
		<u>Define Binary Pair</u>
		A = {0, 1}
		A<sup>n</sup> is the set of all ordered n-tuples with entries of 0 or 1.
		
		<u>3-Bit Binary Number</u>
		{0, 1}<sup>3</sup> = { 
										(0, 0, 0), (0, 0, 1), (0, 1, 0), (0, 1, 1), 
										(1, 0, 0), (1, 0, 1), (1, 1, 0), (1, 1, 1) 
									}
									
		There are 8 elements in the set, which can be used 
		to represent base-10 numbers, 0 to 7.

# 3.6.1 Strings

### Strings, Length, Index
- A <u>string</u> is a sequence of symbols, frequently alphabetic characters.
- The set of characters used in a set of strings is called the <u>alphabet</u>.

- When the elements of an n-tuple are symbols, it can be converted to a string.
	(a, b, c, 1, 2, 3) = "abc123"
	
- The <u>length</u> of a string is the number of characters in the string.
	"Hello" is of length 5.

- The <u>index</u>, of a character represents numerical the position of that character in a string.
	"Hello"\[ 0 \] = "H"
	"Hello"\[ 4 \] = "o"
	"Hello"\[ 1 \] = "e"
	
- Depending on context, an index can start from 0 or 1, and there is a long-standing debate as to which implementation is considered best practice.
  
- Anyone who starts an index from 1 should be shot out of a cannon into the sun.

### Binary Strings

- A <u>binary string</u> consists of only 0s and 1s, so the alphabet of a binary string is {0, 1}.
	
- A <u>bit</u> is a binary digit, and is the smallest unit of information in a standard computer.
- A light switch can represent a bit, where the state of being on or off corresponds with 1 and 0.
- The base-2 numbering system, also known as the binary system, uses bits to represent numercal values.
	
$$
	\begin{aligned}
	10101_2 &= (1)2^4 + (0)2^3 + (1)2^2 + (0)2^1  + (1)2^0 \\
	&= 16 + 0 + 4 + 0 + 1 \\
	&= 21 
	\end{aligned}
$$
- This can be taken advantage of to store alphabetic strings as binary.

|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|
| 01000110 | 01101001 | 01111010 | 01111010 | 01000010 | 01110101 | 01111010 | 01111010 |

- This table uses the [ASCII character set](https://www.w3schools.com/charsets/ref_html_ascii.asp) to convert numbers to characters.

### Empty Strings

- An empty string is sybolized by λ (Lambda) and is similar to an empty set.
- The empty string is the only string of length 0.
- The set of all binary strings of length 0 can be written as: {0, 1}<sup>0</sup> = { λ }.

### Concatenation

- <u>Concatenation</u> of two strings s and t is denoted as st.
- To concatenate s and t, we put them together.
- For example, if s = 010 and t = 101, then st = 010101.
- We can also concatenate a string with a single symbol, such as t0 = 1010.
- Concatenating any string x with the empty string λ gives back x.
- So, xλ = x.

# 3.7 Partitions

### Disjoint Sets

- Sets A and B are <u>disjoint</u> if they have no common elements, and therefore have no overlap.
- The intersection of disjoint sets is the empty set.
  A ∩ B = ∅
  
- <u>Pairwise disjoint</u> sets are those sets in a sequence that do not have any common elements with one another. 
  A<sub>1</sub>, A<sub>2</sub>, ..., A<sub>n</sub> 
  A<sub>k</sub> ∩ A<sub>j</sub> = ∅ for any k and j in the range from 1 through n where k ≠ j.

### Partitions

- A partition is a collection of non-empty subsets of a non-empty set A.
- Each element of A is in exactly one of the subsets.
  
<u>Requirements for a partition</u>
-   For all k, A<sub>k</sub> ⊆ A.
-   For all k A<sub>k</sub> ≠ ∅
-   A<sub>1</sub>, A<sub>2</sub>, ...,A<sub>n</sub> are pairwise disjoint.
-   A = A<sub>1</sub> ∪ A<sub>2</sub> ∪ ... ∪ A<sub>n</sub>

#### Example

![[Discrete Structures - CECS228/attachments/set partition.svg]]

- There are four partitions: letters, numbers, suits, and cat.
- The sum of partition cardinalities is the cardinality of their superset.
