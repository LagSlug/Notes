Sure, here are the notes I've compiled so far from the Pulse-code Modulation (PCM) Wikipedia article.

## Overview
- PCM is a method used to digitally represent sampled analog signals.
- It's the standard form of digital audio in computers, compact discs, digital telephony, and other digital audio applications.
- In a PCM stream, the amplitude of the analog signal is sampled at uniform intervals.

## History
- Early electrical communications started to sample signals in order to multiplex samples from multiple sources.
- Moses G. Farmer conceived telegraph time-division multiplexing (TDM) in 1853.
- W. M. Miner used an electro-mechanical commutator for time-division multiplexing multiple telegraph signals in 1903.
- In 1920, the Bartlane cable picture transmission system used telegraph signaling of characters punched in paper tape to send samples of images quantized to 5 levels.
- British engineer Alec Reeves conceived the use of PCM for voice communication in 1937.
- The first transmission of speech by digital techniques, the SIGSALY encryption equipment, conveyed high-level Allied communications during World War II.
- The T-carrier system, introduced in 1961, uses two twisted-pair transmission lines to carry 24 PCM telephone calls sampled at 8 kHz and 8-bit resolution.
- Adaptive differential pulse-code modulation (ADPCM) was developed in 1973.

## Telephony
- Linear pulse-code modulation (LPCM) is a specific type of PCM where the quantization levels are linearly uniform.
- PCM stream has two basic properties: the sampling rate (number of times per second that samples are taken), and the bit depth (number of possible digital values that can be used to represent each sample).
- The first PCM recorder was developed by NHK's research facilities in Japan in 1967.
- In 1972, Denon unveiled the first 8-channel digital recorder, the DN-023R.
- In 1979, the first digital pop album, Bop till You Drop, was recorded.
- The compact disc (CD) brought PCM to consumer audio applications with its introduction in 1982.
- PCM is the method of encoding typically used for uncompressed digital audio.

## Differential PCM and Delta Modulation
- Differential pulse-code modulation (DPCM) is a variant of PCM that encodes the PCM values as differences between the current and the previous value.
- Adaptive DPCM (ADPCM) is a variant of DPCM that varies the size of the quantization step, to allow further reduction of the required data bandwidth for a given signal-to-noise ratio.
- Delta modulation is a form of DPCM that uses one bit per sample, resulting in a lower bit rate.

I'm still in the process of gathering the remaining information from the article, and I'll share it with you as soon as I can.
