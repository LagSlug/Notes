-   The chapter focuses on alkanes, which are the simplest hydrocarbons, composed of only carbon and hydrogen atoms.
-   Methane can be used as a starting point to construct a vast number of related molecules by replacing one or more of its hydrogen atoms with other carbons and their attendant hydrogens.
-   The chapter introduces the concept of hybridization, which allows for predicting the general structures of compounds and following electron flow in chemical reactions.
-   Methane is a tetrahedral molecule with all carbon-hydrogen bonds of the same length.
-   Different ways of drawing alkane structures are shown, such as solid wedges coming toward you or dashed wedges retreating.
-   The combination of four atomic orbitals of a carbon atom produces four new hybrid orbitals that can overlap with the 1s orbitals of four hydrogens to produce methane.
-   The approach of overlapping 1s atomic orbitals of four hydrogens with 2s and 2p atomic orbitals of carbon does not provide a satisfactory approximation of the structure of methane.
-   The overlap of the occupied carbon 2s, 2px, and 2py atomic orbitals with four hydrogen 1s orbitals results in two C-H bonds formed by the overlap of the carbon 2px and 2py orbitals with hydrogen 1s orbitals, and two additional bonds formed from the overlap of a carbon 2s orbital with two hydrogen 1s orbitals.
-   The model of bond formation in alkane molecules requires 90-degree bond angles and results in bonds of different lengths.
-   The idea that an atomic orbital with two electrons cannot make a bond with two other atoms, each bringing an electron, is a common misconception.
