-   The colors in an image of an atom represent the local electric charge density and the probability of finding an electron at a given point.
-   The old idea of fixed "orbitals" for electrons, known as the Bohr model, is not accurate, and a more appropriate illustration is provided by the principles of modern quantum theory.
-   At the beginning of the past century, the picture of atoms was little different from that of Democritus, who envisioned small, indivisible particles as the constituents of matter.
-   J.J. Thomson's discovery of the negatively charged electron in 1897 led to a dramatic change in the picture of atoms.
-   An electron's energy depends on the distance of its orbit from the positively charged nucleus, and electrons in atoms can only have certain energies.
-   An orbital is the region of space surrounding an atomic nucleus that may be occupied by an electron or pair of electrons of a certain energy.
-   Both the combining of atoms to form molecules and the diverse chemical reactions that molecules undergo involve the interactions of electrons in orbitals.
-   The model that most closely approximates our current understanding of atoms and molecules is the cloudy, indeterminate image of the orbital.
-   The concept of an orbital overlaps with the notion of shells of electrons surrounding the atomic nucleus.
-   Noble gas elements have filled shells of electrons.
-   Formal charge of an atom, especially in a molecule, must be determined.
-   Molecules have their electrons in molecular orbitals.
-   An atom that has more electrons than protons is charged and called an ion.
-   A negatively charged atom or molecule is called an anion, and a positively charged species is a cation.



### Chapter 2

_Keywords:_  
METHANE, STRUCTURE, CARBON, ALKANE, HYDROGEN, MOLECULE, MODEL, BOND, HYBRIDIZATION, orbitals of four hydrogens

-   The chapter focuses on alkanes, which are the simplest hydrocarbons, composed of only carbon and hydrogen atoms.
-   Methane can be used as a starting point to construct a vast number of related molecules by replacing one or more of its hydrogen atoms with other carbons and their attendant hydrogens.
-   The chapter introduces the concept of hybridization, which allows for predicting the general structures of compounds and following electron flow in chemical reactions.
-   Methane is a tetrahedral molecule with all carbon-hydrogen bonds of the same length.
-   Different ways of drawing alkane structures are shown, such as solid wedges coming toward you or dashed wedges retreating.
-   The combination of four atomic orbitals of a carbon atom produces four new hybrid orbitals that can overlap with the 1s orbitals of four hydrogens to produce methane.
-   The approach of overlapping 1s atomic orbitals of four hydrogens with 2s and 2p atomic orbitals of carbon does not provide a satisfactory approximation of the structure of methane.
-   The overlap of the occupied carbon 2s, 2px, and 2py atomic orbitals with four hydrogen 1s orbitals results in two C-H bonds formed by the overlap of the carbon 2px and 2py orbitals with hydrogen 1s orbitals, and two additional bonds formed from the overlap of a carbon 2s orbital with two hydrogen 1s orbitals.
-   The model of bond formation in alkane molecules requires 90-degree bond angles and results in bonds of different lengths.
-   The idea that an atomic orbital with two electrons cannot make a bond with two other atoms, each bringing an electron, is a common misconception.
