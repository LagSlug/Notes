1.1 Structural Components of Organic Molecules

- a carbon atom forms four bonds in a stable compound under normal conditions

![[Organic Chemistry/images/chapter 1/carbon-bonds.png]]
- nitrogen, oxygen, and the halogens form 3, 2, and 1 bond(s) respectively

![[Organic Chemistry/images/chapter 1/nitrogen-oxygen-halogen-bonding.png]]

- a functional group is a reactive center that contains heteroatoms, or has double or triple carbon-carbon bonds.

1.2 Condensed structures eliminate the need to show every atom and bond in a molecule

- there are three hydrocarbon fragments: methyl, methylene, and methine

![[Organic Chemistry/images/chapter 1/hydrocarbon-fragments.png]]

- A structural formula can be represented in a condensed format

![[Organic Chemistry/images/chapter 1/structural-formula-to-condensed-format.png]]

- hydrocarbon fragments can be represented using angled lines and polygons in a line formula

1.3 IUPAC names are created through systematic nomenclature

- the systematic name of an organic molecule is based on the name of the longest carbon chain, or on the size of a ring
- an IUPAC name can be divided into four parts:
	1) names and positions of substituents
	2) the compound's root word
	3) the "multiple-bond index"
	4) the principle functional group

- the compound's root word is derived from the longest continuous carbon chain in the case of aliphatic compounds
- the word "aliphatic" originates from a Greek word for "fat", which was a source for many hydrocarbons in the 1800's
- aliphatic compounds are chains of carbon atoms, either straight or branched, that lack rings
- the root word in the name of an aliphatic compound is based on the identity of the corresponding alkane
- an alkane is a hydrocarbon molecule with only single bonds between atoms
- a *homologous series* is a sequence of compounds with the same functional group and similar chemical properties in which the members of the series can be branched or unbranched, or differ by molecular formula of CH2 and molecular mass of 14u.
- the homologous series for hydrocarbones uses the following prefixes to designate the number of carbon-carbon bonds in a chain: 
	meth, eth, prop, but, pent, hex, hept, oct, non, dec, undec, dodec, tridec, tetradec, pentadec, hexadec, heptadec, octadec, nonadec, and eicos.

![[Organic Chemistry/images/chapter 1/alkane-nomenclature-the-rules-l.jpg]]

- the first four prefixes come from existing names that carried over into the IUPAC system
	- methane was named after "methyl" which was derived  from the Greek words for "wine".
	- ethane was named after "ethyl" which was coined by Justus von Liebig in 1834.
	- propane is from "propionic" which is from Greek words "pro" and "pion", which mean "forward" and "fat".
	- butane comes from "butyl" which is itself from "butyric", which meant "pertaining to or derived from butter" (1823). The stem "butyr" comes from the Latin word "butyrum" which means "butter"
- the rest of the prefixes are derived from Greek numeral prefixes

- an alicyclic (aliphatic cyclic) compound contains at least one all-carbon ring, which must have "a preponderance of single bonds" and is non-aromatic.
	- "a preponderance of single bonds" means that a majority of the bonds are single bonds.
	- cyclopentane is an alicyclic compound. It has 5 carbons linked by single bonds (sigma bonds) in a closed loop. So the root word will be "pentane", and it is prefixed with "cyclo"

- Aromatic compounds (arenes) also contain a carbon-carbon ring, but the ring consists of alternating double and single bonds which produce a stabilizing effect through a property called resonance.
- Benzene is the simplest aromatic compound, and it can be drawn several ways:
![[Organic Chemistry/images/chapter 1/Pasted image 20230131043853.png]]
-  The root word "benz-" is used for many benzene derivatives
	- e.g. benzaldehyde, benzoic acid, benzonitrile
- The *multiple-bond index* describes where a double or triple bond is within a molecule.
	- e.g. 1,3-Butadiene has a double bond between the first and second carbons, and the third and fourth carbons
![[Organic Chemistry/images/chapter 1/Pasted image 20230131045357.png]]

- By convetion,. the double or triple bond in a cyclic compound is placed at the 1 position
![[Organic Chemistry/images/chapter 1/Pasted image 20230131045856.png]]

- Cycloalkynes (a cyclic compound with a triple bond) that have fewer than eight carbon atoms in their ring are not stable under normal conditions.
