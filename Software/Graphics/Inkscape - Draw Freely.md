# Features of Inkscape

## Object creation

-   Drawing: pencil tool (freehand drawing with simple paths), pen tool (creating Bézier curves and straight lines), calligraphy tool (freehand drawing using filled paths representing calligraphic strokes)
-   Shape tools: rectangles (may have rounded corners), ellipses (includes circles, arcs, segments), stars/polygons (can be rounded and/or randomized), spirals
-   Text tool (multi-line text, full on-canvas editing)
-   Embedded bitmaps (with a command to create and embed bitmaps of selected objects)
-   Clones ("live" linked copies of objects), including a tool to create patterns and arrangements of clones

## Object manipulation

-   Transformations (moving, scaling, rotating, skewing), both interactively and by specifying exact numeric values
-   Z-order operations (raising and lowering)
-   Grouping objects ("select in group" without ungrouping, or "enter the group" making it a temporary layer)
-   Layers (lock and/or hide individual layers, rearrange them, etc; layers can form a hierarchical tree)
-   Alignment and distribution commands

## Fill and stroke

-   Color selector (RGB, HSL, CMYK, color wheel, CMS)
-   Color picker tool
-   Copy/paste style
-   A gradient editor capable of multi-stop gradients
-   Pattern fills (bitmap/vectors)
-   Dashed strokes, with many predefined dash patterns
-    Path markers (ending, middle and/or beginning marks, e.g. arrowheads)

## Operations on paths

-   Node editing: moving nodes and Bezier handles, node alignment and distribution, etc.
-   Converting to path (for text objects or shapes), including converting stroke to path
-   Boolean operations
-   Path simplification, with variable threshold
-   Path insetting and outsetting, including dynamic and linked offset objects
-   Bitmap tracing (both color and monochrome paths)

## Text support

-   Multi-line text
-   Uses any installed outline fonts, including right-to-left scripts
-   Kerning, letterspacing, linespacing adjustments
-   Text on path (both text and path remain editable)
-   Text in shape (fill shape following stroke)

## Rendering

-   Fully anti-aliased display
-   Alpha transparency support for display and PNG export
-   Complete "as you drag" rendering of objects during interactive transformations

## File formats

-   Perfectly compliant SVG format file generation and editing
-   Live watching and editing the document tree in the XML editor
-   PNG, OpenDocument Drawing, DXF, sk1, PDF, EPS and PostScript export formats and more
-   Command line options for export and conversions
